TOPIC: DEFINITIONS
The following terms are important to know for this module and will help you improve your mortgage
vocabulary and knowledge of the universe of real estate financing. Be sure to memorize these terms to
improve your exam scores.
Residential Real Land with a maximum of 4 dwelling units designed for occupancy. Land with
Estate greater than 4 dwelling units would not be considered residential and would be
commercial. The 4 types of residential units include:
Single – unit designed for single family
Duplex – two units
Triplex – three units
Quadplex – four units
Residential Real This is a loan for personal, family, and household reasons. The loan will require the
Estate Loan property being purchased to be used as collateral or security for the loan. A
dwelling structure must be on the land; otherwise, intent to add the structure on
the land is required.
Security Documents that are signed by the borrower and then recorded in county
Instrument courthouse records so that the public is aware that the real estate has a claim
against it by a lender.
Lien A claim that is recorded in courthouse records letting the public know that there is
an official claim outstanding. Some liens are voluntary, and some are not.
Generally, liens must be satisfied by the time a sale of the property is completed.
Mortgage Deed Each state determines the type of security instrument. Even if a state uses a deed
and Trust of trust or other security instrument, the industry refers to the loan associated
with the document as a mortgage. Whenever you see the term mortgage and it is
not referring to the actual security document…think “real estate loan”.
Promissory The IOU that the borrower signs promising to pay the loan based on the agreed to
Note terms is the promissory note. It includes the interest rate on the loan referred to
as the note rate and all agreed to conditions relative to payments. It is evidence of
a promise to pay but is not a recorded document.
Hypothecate This means that a borrower can pledge the property as collateral for the loan and
get the benefit of using the property during the loan term.

Equity The value that is accrued in a property less the amount that the borrower owes is
equity. Value comes from funds contributed to the loan balance as well as
environmental factors. The equity built up in a property can be used to secure
another loan.
Amortization The calculation (or formula) a lender uses that outlines the required payments. It
includes the monthly principal and interest required to pay off the debt over a
predetermined period time.
Mortgage Designed to protect the lender in the event a borrower defaults. A borrower will
Insurance be required to purchase mortgage insurance if the loan is considered risky.

TOPIC: MORTGAGE LOAN PROCESS
START: PURCHASE DECISION
Most mortgages follow this same general
process starting with a loan origination and you,
the MLO (Mortgage Loan Originator). Well,
technically, it starts with a borrower wanting to
buy, or, I should say borrow money, to purchase
a property. In this next topic, we’ll lay out a
roadmap you can refer to periodically, so you
know where you are within the process.
Key Points ▪ The participant in this step is the Applicant, or person(s) seeking the loan.
▪ 3 primary reasons for pursuing a real estate financing loan (mortgage loan):
o Purchase real estate
o Refinance an existing loan with a new loan
o Second loan where the first (or primary) loan is maintained, and the
equity is used to secure another loan. When a second loan is acquired,
that loan is junior or subordinate to the primary loan. The original loan
on the property is the primary loan also considered in first position.
▪ Property types / categories
Residential real estate financing is limited to 4 dwelling types (1, 2, 3, 4-unit
dwellings). These dwelling units include three categories:
o Owner occupied - primary residence and the lowest risk to the lender
o Second home - vacation home that comes with a moderate risk
o Investment or rental property - the highest risk to the lender because
the borrower may depend on rental income to make the monthly
mortgage payment
▪ Residential vs. commercial
o Residential lending includes 1, 2, 3, and 4-unit dwellings
o Units greater than 4 are considered commercial financing
▪ An attached property can be a townhouse or a condominium.
o A townhouse is a single-family residence sharing at least one adjoining
wall with another unit. An individual who owns a townhouse has title
to the land and the building structure.
o Condominiums differ from townhouses; ownership extends to the
interior dwelling only. Residents have shared ownership of common
external areas and must pay a monthly, homeowner’s association fee
(HOA).

STEP 1: ORIGINATION
Generally, the applicant will contact the MLO
(Mortgage Loan Originator) via phone, in person,
or through the internet.
Most folks are interested in discussing
qualification requirements and getting pre-
approved so they know how much they can
spend. The lender will review a number of
factors, collect information, inform the applicant
about protections, discuss payments options,
and then determine buying capacity.
Before we dive any deeper it’s important to review key background information about loans and laws.
Loan Programs
There are two major categories of loan types. Government backed loans, those that are guaranteed
or insured by an agency of the federal government, and those that are not.
Key Points Conventional conforming loans:
▪ Loan program not backed by an agency of the federal government
▪ Is the primary loan and meets the loan requirements of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac
▪ Has maximum loan limits of $726,200 for a single unit (considered conforming
loans) and are available for purchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
Non-conforming loans:
▪ Loans that exceed the conforming loan limits are considered non-conforming
or jumbo and are NOT eligible for purchase by Fannie and Freddie.
▪ Generally purchased by private investors
Non-traditional:
Another form of non-conforming loans are non-traditional loans.
▪ Designed for higher risk borrowers
▪ May include risky features and high interest rates
▪ Generally purchased by private investors
Federal Housing Administration (FHA):
FHA loans were created in 1934 to provide affordable financing.
▪ Program under the Housing and Urban Development (HUD), a government
entity that ensures fairness in any aspect of housing
▪ Insures loans against default by borrowers as an incentive for lenders to loan
money to those borrowers
▪ Underwriting standards are more liberal than conventional loans
▪ FHA does not purchase loans; only insures them
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 14 | 35
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
Veterans Administration (VA):
VA loans resulted from the GI bill after the WWII.
▪ Designed for qualified military borrowers
▪ Guarantees a lender’s loss will be covered by VA in the event of a borrower’s
default
▪ Like FHA, VA does not purchase loans, only guarantees them
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA):
The USDA loan program is designed to ensure the development of rural less
populated communities.
▪ Referred to as the Rural Housing Service (RHS) program
▪ Guarantees a significant amount of the loss to the lender if the borrower
defaults
▪ No down payment required
▪ Unlike FHA and VA, USDA is a direct lender and guarantees USDA loans closed
by other lenders
Loan Products
Within each loan program there are loan products. The primary function of a mortgage loan
originator is to find the loan product that’s best for the applicant. Obviously, this is an important part
of your day-to-day responsibilities.
These products vary relative to the degree of risk.
Key Points Fixed loans:
▪ Lower risk product where the interest rate remains fixed over the life of the
loan
▪ Borrower has certainty with principal and interest payments each month
Adjustable rate mortgage (ARM):
▪ Loan product where loan rates can vary over the term of the loan
▪ Most ARMs have an introductory period where the rate is fixed; these loans
are referred to as hybrid arms
▪ Fixed periods on a typical 30-year ARM loan (hybrid) vary from 3-10 years
▪ ARM rate changes based on an index (market instrument not under the
control of the lender)
▪ Lenders add their profit (margin) to the index to determine rate
▪ Lenders establish caps (limits up and down) to avoid uncontrolled swings in
the rate that could put the consumer at risk
▪ Lenders are required to provide consumers with an ARM handbook along with
disclosures about ARM specifics
Interest-only:
▪ Allows the borrower to pay only the interest during a portion of the loan
▪ No reduction of principal is made during the interest only (I/O) period
▪ Product referred to as a “non-moving loan” because the principal is not
moving during the interest only period
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 15 | 35
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
▪ Although payments during the I/O period are very affordable, the borrower
will be required to make a higher payment including contribution to principal
once the interest only period ends
Reminder Important:
Any loan product that does not require a reduction of principal poses a risk to both
the lender and the borrower.
Negative amortization:
▪ Allows borrower to defer a portion of the interest payment
▪ When interest portion of a payment is not covered, the borrower still owes
the portion that was not paid (means principal amount increases)
▪ This loan product (called an option ARM) was popular when home values were
rising, and the deferred interest could be hedged against the rising property
values
Home equity loans:
▪ Home equity loans are loans secured by the equity in a borrower’s home.
▪ Generally, in a secondary lien position because there is usually a primary loan
▪ Two types of home equity loans - fixed rate & term and lines of credit
▪ Fixed Rate Home Equity Loans:
o Generally referred to as a second mortgage
o Fixed rate and a fixed term, generally with a 15-year maximum
o All the proceeds are received at closing and the loan is fully amortized,
meaning the payment plan will pay off the loan by the loans due date
▪ Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC):
o Open-end revolving account secured by the equity in a property
o Generally, in a secondary position subordinate to the primary loan
o Funds are drawn as needed and the required minimum payment
terms are interest only payments until a point when the interest only
period has ended, and the fully amortized payments are required
o Tied to an index and the rates vary based on the index
o The prime index is the most popular index for a HELOC
o Lenders will often provide borrowers with a credit card or checking
account to access funds from the equity line
Balloon mortgage:
▪ Allows borrower to have payment terms that will not pay off the loan by the
due date
▪ When due date arrives, borrower will owe a lump sum to pay off the loan
▪ Loan popular in a rising property value marketplace because borrowers could
refinance the loan to pay off the loan
▪ Risky because if property values fall, then property value may not secure the
loan and create a problem for borrower to get financing
▪ A 360/120 balloon means:
o Borrower making payments based on a 360-month amortization
period
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 16 | 35
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
o Loan is due in 120 months and will require a lump sum payment
Bridge mortgage:
▪ A short-term loan that temporarily extends financing between the termination
of one mortgage and the beginning of another
▪ Serves as a lien against the property up for sale until it is sold
▪ Once the property sells, the bridge loan is paid in full releasing the lien
Construction loans:
A construction loan is a temporary loan during the construction period.
▪ Requires the loan to be paid at the end of the construction period
▪ Permanent financing involves a much longer term typically 15 or 30 years
▪ Like a line of credit, the money is not owed until it is used
▪ Payments made to the builder when each phase of a project is completed are
called draw payments
▪ Only the interest is due during the construction loan period
▪ In summary, a construction loan is characterized by rising principal, draw
payments, and interest only payments.
Construction to permanent loan:
When the permanent financing is combined with the construction loan it is called
a construction perm loan.
▪ Borrower is approved for the permanent financing and the loan is closed
before the construction begins
▪ Characteristics of the construction period remain the same, however, at the
end of the construction period the loan converts to permanent financing
▪ Benefit to the borrower is that there is only one closing which reduces the cost
associated with two closings
Reverse Mortgages:
This type of loan is the opposite of a forward mortgage (where equity is being
created).
▪ Equity is being used or disbursed to the borrower
▪ Product was created to provide seniors over the age of 62 a stream of income
in their later years
▪ Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Reverse mortgage is most
popular; FHA’s version has these features:
o All borrowers must be at least 62 years old
o All borrowers must have counseling from FHA or HUD for the HECM
o Borrowers are responsible for their own taxes and insurance
o Subject property must be the borrowers’ primary address
o At least one borrower must occupy the home
Refinance:
When a borrower wants to replace an existing loan with another loan it is a
refinance transaction.
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 17 | 35
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
▪ Lender’s responsibility to ensure transaction results in a net tangible benefit to
the borrower
▪ Primary types of refinance transactions in residential mortgage financing are:
o Rate and term refinance - reduce the rate and or reduce the term
o Limited cash out refinance - borrower gets some cash back during the
refinance either $2,000 or 2% of the loan amount whichever is less
o Cash out refinance - borrower takes cash out of the equity in the
property to be used for debts not associated with the mortgage
Loan assumption:
Some loan programs are assumable such as FHA, VA and USDA loans.
▪ A borrower may pay a seller for their equity in the property and take over the
loan
▪ Lender must agree that the new borrower is qualified
Reminder Important:
Conventional loans are not assumable because they have a “due on sale” clause,
which means the loan must be paid if the property is sold.
Rules, Regulations, Disclosures
So far, you’ve learned about loan programs and loan product. It’s now time to examine how these are
regulated. Because of the mortgage industry’s complexity, it’s critically important that you focus on
fairness and consumer protections, so applicants are NOT potentially harmed during the loan process.
It’s the largest purchase most folks will make, and any misstep can have life-changing consequences.
Because of these concerns, many laws have been enacted over the years to ensure that the process is
fair, and the average consumer does not become a victim of unscrupulous mortgage activity. What
follows is an introduction to some of the most important regulations.
Key Points
Dodd Frank Act:
▪ The umbrella authority for most of the residential mortgage related laws
▪ Enacted to provide a broad area of protections for consumers relating to
financial services
▪ Authorized the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
which is the rulemaking and enforcement agency for the Dodd Frank Act
▪ Most of the laws that regulate the residential mortgage industry are now
under the umbrella of the CFPB
Fair lending laws:
▪ Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) – ensures fairness in the application
process, the extension of credit, and the appraisal disclosure requirements
▪ Fair Housing Act (FH Act) – ensures fairness in the extension of credit relating
to housing and other housing related discrimination practices
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 18 | 35
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
▪ Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) – ensures fairness on a larger scale by
looking at patterns of discrimination
Consumer protection laws:
Consumer protection laws address the requirement that all MLOs pass FBI criminal
background checks and register with and receive a unique identifier number from
the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing Registry (NMLS).
▪ Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act (SAFE Act) –
Requires MLOs, employed by a non-depository institution, to be state
licensed, complete pre-license education, pass a national exam, and on annual
basis, complete ongoing continuing education
▪ Gramm, Leach, Bliley Act (GLBA) - protects consumer’s non-public
information. Includes Safeguards Rule, Pretexting, and Financial Privacy (SPF)
▪ Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act (FACTA) - protects consumer’s
information from identity thieves
▪ Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) – ensures accuracy of credit related
information and how it’s collected and reported
▪ Homeowners Protection Act (HPA) – ensures the right to have mortgage
insurance automatically terminated or the right to request the cancellation of
Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)
▪ The Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) – ensures the right to place a number on a
registry to avoid solicitations by marketers and the establishment for times
when contact can be made
▪ National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) – ensures the requirement to carry
flood insurance when a consumer’s structure is in an area that has 1% chance
of being inundated by flood waters in any given year
▪ The Ability to Repay/Qualified Mortgage Rule (ATR/QM) - requires lenders to
verify a borrower’s ability to repay the loan before it closes
▪ Mortgage Acts and Practices (MAP) - requires that non-depository institution
lenders avoid deceptive advertising when promoting mortgage loan products
Cost of Services:
Laws relating to cost of services and financing (special disclosures are required)
include:
▪ Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) - regulations and disclosures
relating to the cost of services
▪ Truth-in-Lending Act (TLA) - regulations and disclosures relating to the cost of
financing
▪ TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule (TRID) - regulations and disclosures for
lenders that close more than five loans annually
▪ The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) and The Higher
Priced Mortgage Loan Act (HPML) - regulations and disclosures for lenders
that offer loans which exceed certain thresholds like interest rates and fees

STEP 1: ORIGINATION
We’re going to return to the Mortgage Loan
Process. As you may remember, the process
begins with someone wanting to buy a home.
The next step is for them to meet with a lender,
or specifically with you, the Mortgage Loan
Originator.
General Process Steps
Key Points Loan application:
▪ Consumer protection laws help protect applicants as they meet with MLOs
▪ Applicant info should be available during this meeting and include:
o Two years of residence history
o Two years of employment history
o Source of money needed to close
o Credit report to show debts and credit history
NOTE: The MLO may ask for a credit report fee at this time. This is the
exact cost of the third-party credit report fee. The company is NOT
allowed to make a profit on third party fees.
o Debts like child support and alimony do not show on the credit report
Automated underwriting:
Once the preliminary qualification is complete, the MLO (or designated person)
will input the information into an automated underwriting system (i.e., DU/LP,
Total Scorecard, or GUS) to:
▪ Determine the debt to income ratio (DTI) and the housing payment ratio
▪ Determine the maximum loan to value (LTV) based on the funds available
▪ Determine the appropriate loan program
▪ Determine the most suitable loan product
After pre-approval:
▪ MLO turns over signed loan application and disclosures to a loan processor
▪ MLO sends pre-approval letter to borrower
• Borrower may contact real estate agent to find a home
Reminder Important:
The fair lending laws protect applicants against discrimination based on several
prohibited factors.

STEP 2: PROCESSING STAGE 1
The next step in the mortgage loan process is
processing. Processing happens in a few stages.
General Process Steps
Key Points Verification of information:
The primary participant at this stage is the processor. They will:
▪ Verify the applicant’s information for accuracy including:
o Employment
o Bank balances
o Rental/mortgage payment history
▪ Ensure required information identified during the automated underwriting
stage has been collected
▪ Ensure file is ready for a final review by the underwriter
Processor and MLO collaborate:
▪ Processor works with MLO to collect any missing or outstanding items
▪ MLO delivers a pre-approval letter to borrower
Processor waits:
At this point, the processor waits for sales contract from real estate agent.

STEP 3: REAL ESTATE ACTIVITY
With the borrower pre-approved and informed
about what they can afford, it’s time to partner
with a real estate agent.
Of course, this step may occur earlier, but for
this training we assumed the borrower wanted
to get pre-approved first.
General Process Steps
During this step, the borrower and real estate agent are the primary participants, until they sign the
contract and send it to the MLO.
Key Points Borrower engages a realtor to secure a contract to purchase from a seller:
▪ Searches for home
▪ Finds home
▪ Makes offer on home
Offer accepted
▪ Contract executed
▪ Realtor sends copy of contracts to MLO
▪ Once copy received, application is completed

STEP 4: PROCESSING STAGE 2
Processing continues during this stage.
After the MLO receives the contract, there are
certain requirements of the MLO. After the
MLO has completed their responsibilities, they
turn over the file to the Processor.
General Process Steps
During this step, both the MLO and processor are participants.
Key Points MLO receives intent to proceed:
▪ MLO provides disclosures by mail, email or upon consent (through ESIGN rule)
electronically
▪ One of the most important disclosures will be the loan estimate that includes:
o All the fees, rates, and payment for principal and interest
o Annual percentage rate (includes the dollar amount the loan will cost
annualized over the term of the loan)
o Information about mortgage insurance (if required)
o Estimated taxes and insurance and assessments
o Estimated amount needed to close the loan
o Services the borrower can shop for
o Services the borrower pays for that cannot be shopped (i.e., appraisal
and credit report fees)
▪ Other information and considerations MLO discloses include:
o The appraisal
o If the loan is assumable
o Borrower’s right to select own provider of property insurance
o Late payment terms
o If the lender intends to service or not to service the loan
Reminder Important:
When the borrower signs the loan estimate, they ONLY confirm receipt of
disclosures. Borrowers are NOT required to accept the loan because of disclosures.
MLO receives intent to proceed:
Once the MLO receives an intent to proceed, (means borrower wants to move
forward with the loan) the MLO will:
▪ Offer to lock in the interest rate
▪ Inform borrower of the payment process for the appraisal or get them to
execute a credit card authorization for the fee
▪ Turn the file over to the processor

STEP 5: PROCESSING STAGE 3
We reached the last stage of processing. Here
the processor orders different items, confirms
information, and may work behind the scenes
with others to the ensure the loan is processed
correctly.
In the end, they submit the file onto the
underwriter.
General Process Steps
Key Points Processor order:
▪ The processor is the primary participant at this stage
▪ Either the processor (or designated person) will order an appraisal of value
and the preliminary title report to get the details relating to ownership, liens,
taxes, easements, etc. associated with the property
Processor confirms:
▪ The processor verifies information and may need to contact borrower for
something that is missing or needed for the loan file.
▪ NOTE: the processor is not a loan originator and has no involvement with the
loan terms or rates or negotiating those items.
Processor submits:
Once the processor has completed the verifications the loan file is submitted to
the underwriter.

STEP 6: Underwriting
Now it’s the underwriter’s turn to review the file
sent to them from the Processor. They’ll make
sure it meets the conditions for the loan program.
The underwriter reviews the loan file to ensure it
meets the conditions for the loan program and
loan product being offered prior to approving it.
General Process Steps
At this step, the primary participant is the underwriter. However, the MLO and processor also have a
part to play.
Key Points Underwriter reviews:
▪ The loan file to ensure it meets the conditions for the loan program and loan
product being offered
▪ The appraisal to ensure the value of the property adequately secures the loan
being sought
▪ Title report to ensure the property is free of any encumbrances that could
prevent a clear title and also if the chain of ownership and other factors, such
as the taxes, are correctly accounted for in the loan calculations
Processor clears conditions:
Any outstanding conditions are cleared by the efforts of the processor and the
mortgage loan originator.
Final approval:
After conditions are cleared, the underwriter issues a final approval and sends the
loan file to pre-closing.

STEP 7: Pre-Closing
The borrower is in the ‘home stretch’. At this
point, documents are being finalized and a closing
date is being scheduled.
General Process Steps
Key Points Pre-closer coordination:
While the pre-closer is the primary participant at this step, there is a lot of
coordination going on with the closing agent, title company, realtor, seller, and
borrower.
Schedule closing:
Pre-closer schedules the closing and/or consummation date when the legal
documents will be executed.
Disclosures finalized:
Pre-closer provides additional disclosures during this process:
▪ The most important disclosure is the closing disclosure which must be delivered
to the borrower at least 3 business days prior to consummation
▪ NOTE: The closing disclosure resembles the loan estimate in structure and is
easy for the borrower to compare differences from the estimate to the final
disclosure
▪ Revised disclosures are delivered if changes requiring additional disclosures are
made

STEP 8: Closing
The borrower is almost done. Now there are a lot
of documents to sign.
General Process Steps
Key Points Closing starts:
The closing agent takes the lead during this step; however, nearly all parties are
involved in some way to ensure a successful closing.
▪ Consummation and Closing occurs with a closing agent who may be an
attorney, a title company, or an escrow agent. The choice is based on state
customs.
▪ Consummation occurs when the legal documents (specifically when the
promissory note is signed) are executed, however, the loan has not been
funded.
▪ The lender will clear the funding conditions and close the loan (process adds a
few days to the process prior to closing)
▪ Consummation may also take place the same day as closing (means the loan is
funded the same day the legal documents are executed)
Reminder Important:
State customs determine if the loan is consummated and closed the same day or if
they are done at different times.
Borrower responsibility:
At the closing the borrower:
▪ Brings certified or wired funds
▪ Executes legal documents including the promissory note and the security
instrument
▪ Signs and verifies certain loan related documents in the presence of the closing
agent
▪ Receives the initial escrow statement, if applicable
▪ Lender ensures funds are available
▪ Disbursements are processed for all parties
MLO Responsibility:
▪ May attend closing, although not a requirement
Final steps:
▪ Lender ensures funds are available
▪ Disbursements are made to all parties
▪ Borrower receives keys to the home

STEP 9: Post-Closing
The borrower is now a homeowner. Besides the
normal home maintenance, their loan must also
be serviced.
General Process Steps
Key Points Documentation:
▪ Documents returned to lender
▪ Security instruments recorded
Loan servicing:
The servicer is the primary participant during this final step. Depending on whether
the loan is sold or not, the lender will service the loan or hand it off to another
servicer.
Service release premium: A servicer will pay a lender for the right to service a loan.
The fee that a servicer pays the lender is a service release premium (SRP).
Sold with recourse: When a lender sells a loan to an investor the lender agrees to
buy back the loan if certain conditions are not met or, for example, the loan is
found to be fraudulent. The lender sells the loan with recourse.
