After the second world war ended, the government created opportunities
for returning servicemen and women to participate in homebuying
opportunities by providing a loan guarantee program.
Unlike some military benefits (healthcare, insurance, etc.) veterans are not
immediately granted the benefit of a VA loan. Like everyone else, they
must apply for the VA loan, have their credit checked, and qualify.
What the VA loan does do is offer some guarantees, making it easier to
qualify for the loan, along with features that are favorable to the military
borrower.
The program has evolved from its initial guarantee limits to current
guarantee limits that are consistent with the conventional conforming
guidelines.
NOTE: Fannie Mae will purchase VA loans that stay within the Fannie Mae
conforming guidelines.

VA Loan Features
VA loans offer a number of features that are unique and beneficial for currently active or
retired veterans and their spouses.

VA Loans
VA loans have the following general
features.
 VA allows 100% financing for qualified
military borrowers.
 VA does NOT have a maximum loan
amount but it DOES have a maximum
guarantee amount.
 Lenders can make loans the borrower
can qualify for however, VA has a
guarantee limit.
 VA uses the Fannie Mae conforming
loan limits as a maximum guarantee
amount for most counties around the
country.
 VA will guarantee 25% of the loan
amount (up to the guarantee amount) in
the event of the borrower’s default.
Example:
Borrower has been approved for a VA loan
of $726,200. $726,200 x 25% = $181,550 in
guarantees.
 Housing expense ratio (front end ratio)
maximum = 41%
 DTI ratio (back end ratio) maximum =
41%

VA Entitlement, Discharge, and Fees
What is a VA entitlement?
Unfortunately, it can be confusing. In simplest terms, a loan entitlement is a dollar amount the VA
promises to repay back to a lender in the event of a borrower’s default. Generally, it’s 25% of the
loan amount.
Lenders will usually loan up to 4 times a Veteran's available entitlement without a down payment,
provided the Veteran is income- and credit-qualified, and the property appraises for the asking
price.
There are 2 tiers of entitlements.
The 1st tier is up to $36,000 and an additional, secondary entitlement of $145,550 ($181,550 -
$36,000). Add those together and you get $181,550 ($726,200 x .25).
In most counties, the maximum loan limit is $726,200. In high cost counties, the VA will still
guarantee 25% which means the guarantees may be higher than the $181,550 entitlement amount.
Lenders should use Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac 1-unit maximum conforming loan limits charts.

VA Entitlement, Discharge, and Fees
Discharge Status and Loan Eligibility
✓ When a military borrower leaves the Service, they receive a
DD214 discharge document that shows proof of their
service and the nature of their discharge.
✓ To be eligible for VA guaranteed financing the borrower
must have a certificate of eligibility (proof of entitlement)
and a DD214 reflecting an honorable discharge.
VA Funding Fee
The VA funding fee is a charge assessed by the VA to receive a VA
guaranteed loan. It’s a form of mortgage insurance (i.e., protects lender
in the event of borrower default). The table below shows first time and
subsequent users and veteran types pay different percentages. The
greater the down payment, the lower the funding fee percentage is.

✓ First time regular military users with less than 5% down are required
to pay an upfront funding fee of 2.15% of the loan amount.
Example: $144,000 x 2.15% = $3,096 funding fee.
✓ Subsequent use of the loan entitlement will result in increased
funding fee percentages.
✓ A borrower that is considered disabled because of military action is
exempt from paying the upfront funding fee.
✓ A surviving spouse of those who died in the service, or from service
related disabilities are exempt from paying the funding fee.
✓ VA doesn’t allow a funding fee refund if borrower pays off the loan.
✓ VA does not have an annual funding fee just an upfront funding fee.
✓ VA funding fees may be financed into the loan amount, paid by the
borrower upfront or paid by the seller.

Residual income is the
amount of income
leftover at the end of
the month after all
debts (including
mortgage) is paid.
About Residual Income
The VA loan program is the only program that underwrites loans with a significant emphasis on residual income
when qualifying the borrower for a VA guaranteed loan.
VA actually puts more value on residual income than the DTI.
 VA wants to ensure there is enough income remaining each month after the mortgage payment and other
recurring qualifying expenses.
 Residual income calculation is based on:
o Loan amount, and
o Where the borrower lives, and
o Square footage of the home, and
o How many persons will occupy the home.
 Residual income varies based on location.
Example: the residual income requirements in Jackson, Mississippi would be less than in Los Angeles, CA.
The VA wants to know that veterans have enough residual income to keep their household afloat. A mortgage
payment can put a new strain on family finances. So, borrowers looking to start the VA loan process will need a
minimum amount of residual income depending on their loan amount, where they live and how many people
live in the home.
Residual income and debt-to-income ratio are interconnected financial guidelines for VA lenders. VA encourages
lenders to put more weight on residual income than DTI ratio, and prospective borrowers with higher debt
ratios will typically need to meet a higher standard for residual income.

The following charts reflect VA residual income requirements across geographic regions. Locate the family size
and geographic region (based on state) to determine the residual income requirement. Here’s an example:
Family: 7 members
Loan Amount: $125,000
State: Idaho
Monthly Income: $6,000
Monthly Debt: $3,300
Monthly Mortgage: $1,452
Residual income calculation: $6,000 – ($3,300 + $1452) = $1,248 (residual income).
As you can see (table below), a family of 5 in the West (Idaho) has a residual income requirement of $1,158.
This family has 7 members so we need to add $80 for each additional family member.
$1,158 + $80 + $80 = $1,408. Acceptable residual income is $1,318 ($1,158 + $80 + $80). This borrower does
NOT meet the criteria.
