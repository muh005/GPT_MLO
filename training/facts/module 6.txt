TOPIC: DEFINITIONS
The following terms are important to know for this module and will help you improve your mortgage
vocabulary and knowledge of the universe of real estate financing. Be sure to memorize these terms to
improve your exam scores.
Usury The practice of making unethical mortgage loans that may include rates that
exceed the law. States have usury laws that define these usury limits. The
maximum interest rate that can be charged is commonly referred to as the usury
limit.
Index (plural is A market instrument that varies with market conditions. Rates tied to an index can
indices) adjust based on the changes in the index. Popular indices include COFI, LIBOR,
Prime, and T Bill.
COFI (Cost of
The Cost of Funds Index used in adjustable-rate mortgages.
Funds Index)
LIBOR (London
The London Interbank Offered Rate is an index used in the residential mortgage
Interbank
industry for adjustable-rate mortgages.
Offered Rate)
Prime Prime is a popular index used with home equity lines of credit.
T Bill (Treasury
Treasury bill index is used in many longer-term financing products.
Bill)
Hybrid Loan A loan that combines a fixed period and an adjustable period within the same loan
term. For example, a 5/1 ARM has a fixed rate for the first 5 years and then can
adjust every year afterwards.
Cap A percentage limitation on how high or low an adjustable rate may increase or
decrease. We’ll discuss 3 types:
▪ Initial cap: the max limit the first time the rate can adjust
▪ Periodic cap: the max limit each subsequent time the rate can adjust
▪ Life cap: the max limit the rate can adjust over the lifetime of the loan
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 5 | 33
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
Initial, periodic, and life caps are often shown as initial/periodic/life. For example;
2/2/5 means the initial and periodic caps can rise or fall 2% each time they adjust,
but only for a maximum of 5% increase or decrease.
Subprime Refers to non-traditional mortgage loans to borrowers with challenged credit
(poor credit history). These normally carry unfavorable conditions for the
borrower, like higher interest rates, and are riskier for the lender due to the
borrower’s credit.
Secondary The secondary market is where banks and lenders can sell home loans and
Market servicing rights to other lenders and investors. These sales help free up funds so
banks and lenders have money available to make more home loans.
Subordination When there are two mortgages on a home and one of the mortgages must be
subordinated (placed in a lower position).
The most common example is when a borrower has two mortgages and refinances
their first. The lender in first position wants to guarantee repayment of the loan,
so the borrower signs a subordinate agreement indicating the 2nd loan is
subordinate to the first (2nd lien position to the 1st loan). Debts in first position
have a higher priority which enables them to be repaid in full.
Buydown A buy down occurs when a borrower pays an upfront fee on a loan product to
reduce the interest rate over the life of the loan.
Temporary Buydown:
Allows the borrower to buy down the interest rate, but only for a short period
(typically the first 2 or 3 years of the loan).
Basis Point A basis point is a unit of measure: 1/100th of 1% (0.01% or 0.0001). Basis points
are used within the financial industry to communicate differences in interest rates.
Example: 100 basis points = 1% or 1 point in the case of discount points.
Points (Discount Fees paid directly to the lender at closing in exchange for reduced interest rates
Points) are points. The act of paying this fee is also known as “buying down the rate”.
Lower rates can equal lower monthly payments. A point is equal to 1% of your
loan amount (or $1,000 for every $100,000).

TOPIC: LOAN PRODUCT REVIEW
Previously, you learned loan products range from fixed interest rate products to adjustable rate
products to non-traditional loan products.
Within this product range there is generally a loan product that will meet the needs of most borrowers.
Review these loan products.
Key Points ▪ Fixed Rate: Rate remains fixed during the term of the loan.
o Benefit to the borrower: stable principal and interest payment and a
hedge against higher interest rates that may occur during the life of the
loan.
o Benefit to the lender: stable long-term predictable returns.
▪ Adjustable rate: Rate is allowed to change periodically during the term of the
loan.
o Benefit to the lender: the lender is committed to an interest rate for a
shorter period; for example, a 30-year fixed. This allows the lender to
have returns more in line with the changing interest rate marketplace.
o Benefit to the borrower: lower interest rates during the fixed term of
the loan and the borrower can take advantage of lower rates.
o Risk: as interest rates rise, borrower will pay higher rates.
▪ Interest only loan: Interest is paid with no contribution to principal. Considered
a non-moving loan because the principal remains the same during the interest
only payment period.
o Benefit to the borrower: lower payments during the interest only
period.
o The major risk is that there will be higher payments after the interest
only period had ended.
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 9 | 33
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
Key Points ▪ Negative Amortization loan: The interest is deferred during a period of the
loan.
o Borrower still owes the deferred amount.
o Principal has increased.
o Most popular deferred interest program was the “option arm” which
allowed a portion of the interest payment to be deferred.
o Benefit to the borrower: lower payments during the deferred interest
period.
o Risks: if home values decrease, the borrower can be in a position of
owing more than the original debt and/or more than the home was
worth at the time of purchase.
▪ Home Equity Loan: Loans secured by the equity in a borrower’s home.
o These loans are generally in a secondary lien position because there is
usually a primary loan on the property.
o Two types of home equity loans:
• Fixed rate and term: generally referred to as a second mortgage.
This loan has a fixed rate and a fixed term, generally with a 15-
year maximum.
• Line of credit: referred to as a HELOC (Home Equity Line of
Credit). Funds are drawn as needed (like a credit card) and the
required minimum payment terms are interest only payments.
Like an ARM, the loan is tied to an index, so rates vary based on
the index being used.
▪ Balloon Loan: Allows a payment plan that will not pay off the loan by the due
date.
o Benefit to the borrower: lower payments
o Risk: at the end of the loan term a lump sum is due.
o Benefit to lender: short term loan commitment, limits the lenders
exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
▪ Bridge loan: A temporary loan between the sale of one property and the
purchase of another. Generally limited to no more than an 18-month term.
o Benefit to the borrower: provides capital to the borrower during the
transition. Will be paid off from the proceeds of the property for sale.
▪ Construction loan: Loan for the construction period only.
o Benefit to the borrower: funding for home construction that only
requires interest payments during the loan period.
o Risk: the loan must be paid at the end of the construction period.
▪ Construction to Permanent Loan: a permanent loan that includes a
construction loan.
o Benefit to the borrower: combines permanent and construction
financing with one closing instead of two.
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 10 | 33

▪ Reverse Mortgage: A loan product to allow seniors (age 62 or older) to use the
equity in their homes to provide income for the future.
▪ Benefit to the borrower: provides income during the later years in a
consumer’s life.
▪ Refinance loans: A loan product that allows a borrower to refinance an existing
loan by replacing it with a new loan and paying off the balance of the old loan.
▪ Benefit to the borrower: can reduce interest rates and terms, resulting
in savings. Some borrowers may use the proceeds to pay other debts,
often called a debt consolidation loan.
▪ Loan Assumption: borrower assumes an existing loan.
o Assumable loans: include government loan programs like FHA and VA
o Non-assumable loans: conventional loan programs are not assumable
because they have a “due on sale clause”.
o Benefit to the borrower: typically saves loan closing costs.
▪ Loan Modification: modify an existing loan product but does not create a new
loan.
o Benefit to borrower: allows borrowers who may be in danger of
default to avoid foreclosure by modifying existing terms. This is NOT a
form of refinancing.
▪ Non-Traditional Loans: generally, these are loans offered to borrowers with
unique challenges, such as poor credit.
o Benefit to borrower: challenged borrowers can get access to credit.
o Risks: rates are generally higher and loan terms more unfavorable.

TOPIC: ARM LOAN PRODUCT
About ARMS
ARMs are one of the more complicated loan products to understand.
Key Points What’s an ARM?
▪ An adjustable-rate mortgage is a loan product where the interest rate may go
up or down because the interest rate is tied to an index.
What’s an Index?
▪ It’s a financial factor that changes based on market conditions.
▪ Plural for index is indices.
▪ Common indices include:
o COFI: Cost of Funds Index, per the 11th District Federal Home Loan
Bank located in San Francisco.
o LIBOR: London Interbank Offered Rate is an index from the United
Kingdom.
o Prime: popular index used with home equity lines of credit.
o T Bill: Treasury Bill used in many longer-term financing products.
▪ NOTE: Lender is required to provide borrower with historical index
performance.
About ARMs:
▪ Fixed period: most ARMs have a period where the rate remains the same,
followed by a period where the rate may adjust.
▪ Hybrid loans: contain both fixed and adjustment periods within the same loan
term.
ARM tied to Index:
▪ Adjustable rates may adjust each year after a fixed period:
o Fixed period: rate remains the same.
o Adjustment period: rate can fluctuate.
▪ Reset period: period when rate changes from fixed to adjustable.
▪ Fixed periods: range from 1-10 years (when the loan starts).
▪ Shorter fixed periods: lower rates because of the lower risk to lender.
▪ Longer fixed periods: slightly higher rates but more favorable to borrower.
ARM Examples:
▪ 10/1 ARM: fixed rate for 10 years, then rate adjusts each year afterwards.
▪ 5/1 ARM: fixed rate for 5 years, then rate adjusts each year afterwards.
▪ 1-year ARM: rate adjusts each year without a fixed period.

Rate Refresher:
Rate = Index + Margin
▪ Rate: also called the fully indexed rate. A trick to remember the formula
is ”RIM” (Rate = Index + Margin).
▪ Index: benchmark interest rate that the ARM is based on (e.g., COFI, Prime, T-
Bill, LIBOR).
▪ Margin: lender’s profit. Once margin is established on the loan, it does not
change.
Example: a customer has a 5/1 ARM and was locked into it at a 5% fully indexed
rate. The rate includes a fixed index of 3% for 5 years and a fixed margin of 2% for
the life of the loan. In year 6, the rate can adjust and the 3% index could go up or
down. Sometimes there are wild swings in the index.
5/1 ARM (5 years fixed, adjusts each year afterwards)
5% fully indexed rate = 3% (index) + 2% (margin)
If it goes down = that’s good for the borrower.
If it goes up = that means the borrower’s interest rate will increase.
About CAPS
To prevent dramatic swings in the interest rate from impacting the borrower, lenders are legally
required to establish limitations on how high/low the rate can go. These limits are called caps.
Key Points Caps limit: There are three types of caps. They include:
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 13 | 33
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
▪ Initial cap: how much the index can go up/down during the first adjustment
period (reset period).
▪ Periodic cap: how much the index can go up each adjustment period that
follows.
▪ Life cap: how much in total the index can go up. Most commonly this is held
to 5%.
NOTE: These caps are sometimes displayed as 2/2/5 which means the initial cap is
2%, the periodic cap is 2%, and the life cap is 5%.
5/1 ARM example:
5/1 ARM
Initial cap = 2%
Periodic cap = 2%
Lifetime cap = 5%
Benchmark index used = LIBOR
Year 1
Index rate = 3%
3% + 2% = 5% rate
Year 2
Index rate = 3.5% (increases)
3% + 2% = 5% rate (no changed locked in rate)
Year 3
Index rate = 4.0% (increases)
3% + 2% = 5% rate (no changed locked in rate)
Year 4
Index rate = 5.0% (increases)
3% + 2% = 5% rate (no changed locked in rate)
Year 5
Index rate = 6.0% (increases)
3% + 2% = 5% rate (no changed locked in rate)
Year 6
Index rate = 6.5% (increases)
5% + 2% = 7% rate (although index has increased 3.5%, initial cap limits index
increases to 2%)
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 14 | 33
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
Year 7
Index rate = 7.5% (increases)
7% + 2% = 9% rate (periodic cap limits index increases 2%)
Year 8
Index rate = 9.0% (increases)
8% + 2% = 10% rate (life cap limits index increases 1% as borrower has reached 5%
total increase from 3% to 8%)
Years 9 – 30 (increases)
Index rate varies but this specific rate will never be higher than 5% (starting rate) +
5% index increase or lower than the 2% margin (can’t be lower as lender must
receive profit margin).

MICR Principal
This chart called MICR, short for Margin, Index, Caps, and Rate can help you explain to customers
what they can expect with interest rates.
Key Points Here is a different 5/1 ARM example.
Notice the margin is lower. This time, the rates will go up and down.
Margin: once set at 1.5% it does not change.
Index: represents the LIBOR index %.
Rate: increases and decreases can be added/subtracted from the rate.
MICR Example:
5/1 ARM
Benchmark index = LIBOR
Initial cap = 2%
Periodic cap = 2%
Life cap = 5%
Comments to the right explain each row. See below table:
Years Margin Index Caps Rate Comments
Start 1.5% 3% n/a 4.5% The caps do not yet apply as
the rate is being established.
1-5 1.5% n/a n/a 4.5% Rate remains fixed for the first
5 years
6 1.5% 10% 2% 6.5% Index increases from 3% to
(initial) 10%, however cap limits the
change to a 2% increase (4.5%
+ 2% = 6.5% fully indexed rate)
7 1.5% 3% 2% 4.5% The index rate drops sharply
(periodic) to 3% from 10%. Although this
is a 7% decline, the cap limits
the decrease to 2% (6.5% - 2%
= 4.5% fully indexed rate)
8 1.5% 7% 2% 6.5% Index increases from 3% to
(periodic) 7%, however cap limits the
change to a 2% increase (4.5%
+ 2% = 6.5% fully indexed rate)
9 1.5% 10% 2% 8.5% Index increases from 7% to
(periodic) 10%, however cap limits the
change to a 2% increase (6.5%
+ 2% = 8.5% fully indexed rate)
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 16 | 33
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
10 1.5% 12% 2% 9.5% Index increases from 10% to
(periodic) 12%, however cap limits the
change to a 1% increase
because borrower has reached
5% life cap maximum (8.5% +
1% = 9.5% fully indexed rate).
9.5% - 4.5% starting rate is 5%.
11-30 1.5% varies See note See Note:
note During the life of the loan the
index will vary. However,
because the life cap on the
loan is 5% that means no
matter how high the index
rises the rate will never be
higher than the start rate of
9.5% (4.5% start + 5%) or
lower than 1.5% margin (4.5%
start - 5% will never be lower
than margin)
ARM Disclosures
The following includes the ARM requirements for disclosure, timing, and advertising. Please review
this information carefully as you’ll need to apply it.
Key Points Must be disclosed to borrower:
▪ Index used (i.e., COFI, LIBOR, Prime, T Bill.)
▪ Margin added to the index (i.e., 1.5%, 2%, etc.)
▪ Initial cap: % rate adjustment during first adjustment period
▪ Periodic cap: % rate adjustment each subsequent adjustment period
▪ Life cap: overall % rate can adjust during the life of the loan
Timing requirement:
▪ Borrower must be notified between 210 days and 240 days prior to their first
adjustment (reset period).
Reminder Important:
▪ It is a prohibited act in an advertisement for an ARM loan to mention the word
‘fixed’ before the word ‘adjustable’. When the word ‘fixed’ is used it must be
followed in close proximity with the actual fixed term (e.g., 5 years, 7 years,
etc.).

TOPIC: NON-TRADITIONAL LOAN PRODUCT
About Non-Traditional Loans
Non-traditional loans are products generally offered to borrowers with unique challenges. These
challenges may include inadequate or challenged credit or other factors. Borrowers that obtain these
loans are generally referred to as subprime.
These loans carry more risk to lenders than prime borrowers because of consumers’ history with loan
products of this type. They also will have higher interest rates and less favorable loan terms.
Key Points What is a non-traditional loan?
▪ A loan for borrowers with challenged credit
▪ Generally referred to as subprime
▪ Greater risk to lender than prime borrowers
▪ Less favorable loan terms, higher rates for borrower
▪ NOTE: SAFE Act defines non-traditional differently. It is any loan that is NOT a
30-year fixed loan.

Non-Traditional Laws
For many folks who may not be familiar with the mortgage industry, the first time they likely heard
the term subprime was when the mortgage industry was in crisis near the end of 2007.
As you just learned, subprime lending is a riskier form of lending.
Key Points Subprime:
▪ Riskier lending to borrowers with challenged credit
▪ 1980s Congress deregulated subprime safeguards
▪ Deregulated environment created risky lending behavior
Deregulation
The first deregulation we’ll discuss was passed in 1980 by Congress and was called the Depository
Institutions and Deregulation and Monetary Control Act (DIDMCA).
Key Points DIDMCA: Depository Institutions and Deregulation and Monetary Control Act.
▪ Removed rate caps: This Act removed caps on interest rates, so lenders could
charge what they wanted.
▪ Overrode state usury limits: Before that, states placed restrictions on interest
rates. These restrictions were called usury limits. They made lenders subject to
state penalties if they charged rates above these usury limits.
▪ Drove rates higher: By 1982, mortgage interest rates had risen so high (to over
19%) that sales started slowing. Lenders in turn created products so borrowers
could reduce their mortgage payments and rates.
▪ Gave rise to creative loan products: These creative loan products included
ARMS, graduated payments, interest-only, and negative amortization loans.
AMPTA: Alternative Mortgage Transactions Parity Act.
Many states required loan products to be fixed and did not allow these creative
products.
▪ Overrode state restriction on fixed loans: Congress stepped in again and
overrode the states by passing the Alternative Mortgage Transactions Parity Act
(AMPTA).
▪ Gave rise to radical loan products: This Act allowed lenders to offer creative,
less conservative products in ALL states. Examples include: balloon mortgages,
where there is a lump sum payment due at the end of the term, and flexible
ARMS, where borrowers could pay less than the interest due.
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 21 | 33
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
▪ Took away prepayment penalty limits: Opened the door for abusive practices
from unscrupulous lenders.
▪ The prepayment penalty preemption was eventually rolled back in 2002.
Re-regulation
Non- traditional lending became even more risky during the first part of this century when lenders
started to approve borrowers for loans without verifying their ability to repay the mortgage debt.
Lenders took this risk because real estate values kept appreciating. They incorrectly assumed it would
continue upward and their risk could be hedged against the increasing property values.
Key Points Examples of risky loans after deregulation:
▪ Stated income and stated asset loans: SISA
▪ No income no asset loans: NINA
▪ No ratio loans
▪ No documentation loans
Federal Banking Agencies
In 2006 the federal banking agencies sounded the alarm about the irresponsible
underwriting when they came out with the “Interagency Guidance on Non-
traditional Mortgage Product Risk”.
Their objective was to highlight the risks of non-traditional mortgages and
establish guidelines for the industry. Agencies included:

Consumer protection issues:
Consumers should receive adequate information on the risks associated with many
of the non-traditional products.
Concerns and objectives:
▪ Lenders who promote these products must inform the consumer of the
benefits and risks in advance.
▪ Lender focus should be on ensuring borrower is clear about risk vs. selling on
affordability and flexibility.
▪ Borrower must fully comprehend the potential consequences of any risky loan
products and include the potential for future payment increases.
Reminder Important:
Lenders have legal responsibilities. Federal laws like Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA)
and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) mandate lenders properly
disclose fees and rates. Additionally, federal laws also prohibit deceptive
advertising and require that advertising be clear and conspicuous.

Federal Reserve
Key Points The Federal Reserve followed the Interagency Guidance on Non-Traditional
Mortgage Product Risk with a statement on subprime lending which addressed
the risk factors and the recommendation that:
▪ Lenders verify the borrower’s ability to pay before approving the loan.
▪ Ensure that consumers understood the terms of the loans they were receiving.
o Payment shock potential
o Prepayment penalties
o Balloon payment
o Responsibility for taxes and insurance
Reverse Mortgages
Key Points Here are the basics about the most popular form of reverse mortgage called a
Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM).
▪ An FHA federally insured reverse mortgage.
▪ Borrowers must be age 62 or older.
▪ All borrowers must have FHA, HUD, or HECM approved counseling.
▪ Borrowers are responsible for their own taxes and insurance.
▪ Subject property must be borrower’s primary residence.
▪ At least one borrower must occupy the home.
▪ Means testing to qualify the borrower.

Refinance Transactions
Key Points This is the last loan product we’ll review in this module.
A refinance is a loan product where the original loan is being replaced by a new
loan. This process requires the proceeds of the new loan to be used to pay off the
existing loan. There are different reasons for refinancing a loan.
List of the different refinancing options:
▪ Rate and term refinance: Reduces the rate and/or the term.
▪ Limited cash-out refinance: Reduces the rate and/or term and can withdraw
some limited cash from the transaction. Cash is limited to 2% of the loan
amount or $2,000, whichever is less.
▪ Cash out: refinance for the primary purpose of taking cash out from the equity
built up in the property. The loan amount will be higher than the amount owed
on the original loan by the closing costs and additional cash that is desired.
This is often referred to as debt consolidation loan, a loan to pay off existing
debts that generally have nothing to do with the property.
▪ Subordination: required when there are two loans on the property: a first and
a second. The borrower wants to keep the second and refinance the first. The
second lien holder will need to agree to remain in second position allowing the
new loan to be in first position. This means that the second lien holder will
subordinate their position when the first is paid off to allow the new loan to be
in first position.
▪ Loan assumption: a borrower can assume a loan without going through the
normal loan qualifying process that includes lender closing costs. Both FHA and
VA loans are assumable loans with the lender agreeing to allow the new
borrower to assume the loan.
▪ Due on sale clause: conventional loans have a clause that requires the loan to
be paid if the loan is sold or transferred to another party. This means that a
conventional loan is not assumable.

Net Tangible Benefit
You can imagine if lenders benefit from the costs associated with refinance transactions, it’s only fair
that the borrower also benefit.
Key Points Net Tangible Benefit:
▪ Lenders required to ensure transactions are beneficial to borrowers.
▪ Refinanced loan should pass net tangible benefit test.
Examples of a Net Tangible Test:
▪ Going from an ARM to a fixed rate.
▪ Reducing the interest rate.
▪ Reducing the loan term.
▪ Borrower recouping the cost of the refinance within 36 – 48 months.
▪ Borrower receiving cash of at least 3 times the cost to refinance in a cash-
out refinance transaction.

Permanent Buydown
Within most loan products there are variations and opportunities to reduce rates even further. One
such variation is a buydown.
Key Points What is a Buydown? A buydown is when a borrower pays an upfront fee on a loan
product to reduce the interest rate. Literally, they pay a fee for a lower rate.
Buydown options:
▪ Permanent buydown (loan life)
▪ Temporary buydown (limited years)
Permanent buydown (loan life) - with a permanent buydown, the borrower,
seller, or lender pays an upfront fee, called a discount point, to reduce the interest
rate over the life of the loan.
Example:
Let’s say a borrower is buying a home
for $240,000. They pay a down
payment of $40,000 that leaves a loan $240,000 (home value)
balance of $200,000. - $40,000 (down payment)
= $200,000 loan
Let’s say the interest rate is 4%. If
nothing changes and they lock in their
Interest rate = 4%
interest rate at 4%, their principal and
P&I on $200,000 = $954/monthly
interest would be $954/month (before
taxes, mortgage insurance, etc.).
Lender offers 2 discount points to
However, what if the borrower can buydown interest rate .5%
lower their interest rate by .5% with a
permanent buydown? Let’s do the $954/monthly
math. - $898/monthly
= $56 (monthly savings)
A 3.5% interest rate equates to a P&I
x 12__________
of $898/month.
= $672 (annually)
That’s $56 savings monthly, $672 x 30 years_____
annually, and more than $20,000 over = $20,160 (lifetime savings)
the life of the loan.
1 discount point = 1% of loan
That’s a nice savings. Let’s see what it
will cost to get the savings.
Our examples
What if the lender offers the .5% rate 2 discount points = 2% x $200,000 =
decrease for 2 discount points? Again, $4,000 fee
let’s do the math.
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 28 | 33

Each discount point = 1% of the loan
amount. In this case, the loan amount
is $200,000, so 2 discount points, is 2%
of $200,000, and that equals $4,000 to
buydown the interest rate to save
$20,000 over the life of the loan.
The borrower, seller, or lender
themselves may pay to buydown the
interest rate. In any case, the discount
points must be paid up front.

Buydown Practice Part 1
This is a two-part practice. First, you’ll identify the P&I for 2 different rates. Then you’ll identify the
discount point cost and savings.
Key Points Basic Information you will need:
▪ Reminder marker if you forget how to identify the P&I
▪ Amortization Tables
▪ Then fill in the 5 blanks
Home value = $300,000
Down payment = $60,000
Loan length = 30 years
Current interest rate offer = 4.5%
Potential buydown rate = 3.75%
Challenge: Figure out the P&I on the loan value at 4.5% and at 3.75%.
P&I for $240,000 at 4.5% interest = ________
P&I for $240,000 at 3.75% interest = ________
Savings for lower rate each month = ________
Savings annually = _____
Savings over loan life = ______
Buydown Practice Part 2
Key Points You identified the savings. Now figure out what it will cost. The lender is offering
the 3.75% for 2.5 discount points.
$240,000 x _____% = $________

Temporary Buydown
These buydowns are like permanent buydowns except they’re typically at the beginning of the loan
for the first 1 to 3 years.
Key Points Because they are temporary, they are usually offered by the seller (or home
builder) as an incentive to encourage the borrower to buy now by luring them with
a lower rate the first few years.
▪ Rate is reduced only during the buydown period (1-3 years generally).
▪ Fees are paid up front, most frequently by seller as a part of closing costs.
▪ Reverts to note rate after buydown period for the remainder of the loan.
▪ Examples include 2/1 or 3/2/1 temporary buydowns.
Review the chart to understand the savings and how the discounted rates
increase.
Loan amount: $160,000
Interest rate: 5.75%
Temporary buydown: 3/2/1
Year Rate Payment Saving Saving
Monthly Annually
1 2.75% (-3%) $653 $281 $3,372
2 3.75% (-2%) $741 $193 $2,316
3 4.75% (-1%) $835 $99 $1,188
4-30 5.75% $934
Total $6,876

Basis Points
Basis points are a method of communicating within the financial industry, particularly in the mortgage
financing industry.
Key Points A basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1%. This means 100 basis points is equal to 1%.
Example:
▪ 100 basis points = 1%
▪ Discount points:
o 1 discount point = 100 basis points
o .5 discount point = 50 basis points
Loan origination compensation is calculated using basis points.
Example 1:
A mortgage loan originator earns 100 basis points on his loan volume. If he closes a
loan for $200,000, he would receive a commission of $2,000 which is 1% of the
$200,000 or 100 basis points.
Example 2:
A borrower has been told by the lender that her rate will be reduced by 25 basis
points. If her rate was previously 4.25%, her new rate would be 4%.
Example 3:
A borrower has been told it will cost 200 basis points to reduce her rate. If the loan
amount is $100,000 it will cost the borrower $2,000 which is 2% of $100,000.
