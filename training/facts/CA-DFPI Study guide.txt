Rules of Conduct for NMLS Approved Pre-
Licensure (PE) and Continuing Education (CE)
Courses
The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act (SAFE ACT) requires that state-licensed
MLO’s complete pre-licensing (PE) and continuing education (CE) courses as a condition to be licensed.
The SAFE Act also requires that all education completed as a condition for state licensure be NMLS
approved. Since 2009 NMLS has established course design, approval, and delivery standards which NMLS
approved course providers are required to meet. To further ensure students meet the education
requirements of the SAFE Act, NMLS has established a Rules of Conduct (ROC). The ROC, which have been
approved by the NMLS Mortgage Testing & Education Board, and the NMLS Policy Committee, both of
which are comprised of state regulators, are intended to stress that NMLS approved education be
delivered and completed with integrity.
Rules of Conduct
NMLS approved course providers are not authorized by NMLS to grant exceptions to these rules and that I
alone am responsible for my conduct under these rules. I also understand these rules are in addition to
whatever applicable rules the course provider may have set.
Additionally, I understand that the course provider or others may report any alleged violations to NMLS.
NMLS may conduct an investigation into alleged violations and may report alleged violations to the
state(s) in which I am seeking licensure or maintain licenses, or to other states.
As an individual completing either pre-licensure education (PE) or continuing education (CE) I attest the
course format I am being credit banked for has been entirely completed be myself alone and have met

SECTION: LICENSE LAW AND REGULATIONS
How Statutes and Regulations are Created
§ Like the U.S. government, this state’s government is divided into 3 separate branches:
o Legislature (Senate and Assembly members elected by citizens)
o Judiciary (includes trial courts, Courts of Appeal, state Supreme Court)
o Executive (includes governor’s office)3
§ The legislative branch of the state’s government creates new laws as follows:
1. A bill is introduced in either of the state’s legislature's houses (Senate or the
Assembly).
2. An identical version of the bill is passed in both houses and sent to the Governor
for signature.
3. The Governor signs the bill.
4. The bill is "chaptered" by the Secretary of State and becomes an enacted statute.
5. The statute is codified in the appropriate section(s) of the state’s code.5
Rulemaking
A variety of state agencies, departments, offices, commissions, boards, etc. carry out the laws
found in statutes. These entities are created by the state’s constitution or statute. The groups
often have "rulemaking" power (e.g., making of rules and regulations).
Depending on the authority granted under the statute (or constitution), these entities may
follow the Administrative Procedure Act to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations.3
Constitutional Terms
§ Statutes: are Chaptered Bills. A bill is “chaptered” by the Secretary of State after it has
passed through both houses of the legislature and is signed by the Governor (or
becomes law without the Governor’s signature).
§ Articles: the state’s constitution groups areas of the law by subject matter. These are
known as Articles. Each Article is organized by a heading and section numbers.4

California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50142]
Persons Required to be Licensed
In State or Out-of-state
Licensed vs. Registered MLOs
§ A licensed MLO works for a non-depository institution (lender or broker) and must
meet the following guidelines to obtain and maintain a license:
o Complete 20 hours of pre-license education
o Complete 8 hours of continuing education annually
o Pass a national exam (In some states, may be required to complete state-specific
mandated education)
o Work for a sponsor (employer)
o Named on the surety bond of a sponsor or participate in a state recovery account
o Obtain a unique identifier from the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System
(NMLS)
o Process license application requirements via the NMLS
§ A registered MLO works for a depository institution (bank or credit union) and must
meet the following guidelines:
o Works for a sponsor (employer)
o Obtain and maintain a unique identifier from the NMLS
W2 Processors vs. Independent Contract Processors
Processors provide a very important service, in that they perform important clerical functions,
such as verification of employment, ordering appraisals, and scheduling closing dates to settle
loan transactions.
§ A processor who receives a W2 annually from an employer:
o Performs clerical or support duties as an employee.
o May take direction from or may be supervised by a licensed mortgage loan
originator (works for a lender or broker) or a registered mortgage loan originator
(works for a bank or credit union).
§ An independent contract loan processor:
o May represent to the public, through advertising or other means, including the use
of business cards, stationery, brochures, signs, rate lists, or other promotional
items, that they can or will perform any of the activities of a mortgage loan
originator.
o Is required to be licensed as a mortgage loan originator.
An independent contract processor may represent multiple MLOS, brokers, and lenders at the
same time. They are business entities that provide processing services for a fee. An
CA-DFPI SAFE PE Course I Study Guide (v.04122023) Ameritrain. All Rights Reserved. Page 16 | 53
independent contract processor would also need to obtain a broker or company license to
represent more than one broker or company
Reminder: So, while a W2 processor cannot function as a MLO, a contractor processor can.
This also extends to contract underwriters as well.
California Financing Law [CA Fin § 22050-22067]
Exemptions

California Financing Law [CA Fin § 22100-22112]; 10 CCR § 1437
Licensee Qualifications and Application Process
In California, an individual must obtain and maintain a mortgage loan originator license that
includes:
§ A license endorsement from the Commissioner of Real Estate
§ Meet requirements for a licensed MLO
In addition to these things, an individual applying to obtain and maintain a MLO license must
also meet the following:
§ Financial responsibility (net worth)
§ Background check and fingerprints (criminal check; credit report)
§ Pre-licensing education and Experience
§ Testing
§ Pay filing fees
Prior to Congress passing the SAFE Act (the law upon which this state’s MLO licensing
requirement is based), individuals did not need a license to originate loans. Moreover,
individuals did not have to conform to any financial or character standards that would
demonstrate they possess certain characteristics essential for a person to be successful in the
role of MLO.
Today, an applicant must demonstrate:
§ Financial responsibility
§ Character
§ General fitness.
These qualities are deemed important to command the confidence of the community and to
warrant a determination that the mortgage loan originator will operate honestly, fairly,
efficiently, and consistent with the mission of the department.
CA-DFPI SAFE PE Course I Study Guide (v.04122023) Ameritrain. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 | 53
Financial Responsibility (net worth)
In keeping with these characteristics, license applicants must meet certain financial
requirements. The tables below outline these requirements.
Net worth requirements
License Type MLO Employees Minimum Net Worth
Requirement
Finance lender or Broker license None $25,000
Finance lender or Broker license One or more $250,000
(makes residential loans)
Finance broker (arranges, but does One or more $50,000
makes residential loans)
A mortgage lender, mortgage broker, or mortgage lender and broker must post a surety bond
based on the aggregate dollar amount of residential mortgage loans originated by the
mortgage lender, mortgage broker, mortgage lender and broker in the preceding year. A
finance company that does not make residential mortgage loans and does not employ one or
more mortgage loan originators will post a surety bond in the amount of $25,000.
Minimum Bond Requirement
License Type Aggregate Loans Minimum Bond
Residential Mortgage lender $50,000 (Can increase
or Servicer license to $100,000 by
Regulatory authority)
Mortgage Lender, Mortgage 0 - $1,000,000 $25,000
Broker, Mortgage Lender $1,000,001 - $50,000,000 $50,000
and Broker $50,000,001 - $500,000,000 $100,00
Over $500,000,001 $200,000
A mortgage lender, mortgage broker, or mortgage lender and broker applicant without a prior
year operating history will make a good faith estimate of the aggregate amount of loans
anticipated to be originated in the upcoming year to determine the amount of the surety
bond.
When an action is commenced on a licensee’s bond, the regulatory authority may require the
filing of a new bond. Immediately upon the recovery of an action on the bond, the licensee
must file a new bond.
A surety bond is an agreement between three parties – the licensee (a broker or lender), a
surety (insurance company) and the regulatory authority (CA-DFPI). Upon execution, the
instrument commits each licensee to comply with laws and regulations surrounding the
issuance of their license. If for some reason a licensee is unable to meet any of those
requirements successfully, then the surety will assume financial obligations to ensure
performance under that bond on behalf of the licensee. Financial obligations are for amounts
owed to consumers, who qualify, other creditors, or possibly the Department.
CA-DFPI SAFE PE Course I Study Guide (v.04122023) Ameritrain. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 | 53
Reminder: The regulatory authority may make or edit rules or regulations that affect the
requirements for minimum net worth, to ensure compliance with the SAFE Act.
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50146]
Background Check and Fingerprints (criminal check; credit report)
License applicants must pass certain background and credit checks through the NMLS.
MLOs must:
§ Submit fingerprint images and related information to enable a federal, or both a state
and federal, criminal history background check
§ Complete an application containing personal history and experience via a form on the
NMLS including providing an authorization to NMLS and the regulatory authority to
obtain:
o An independent credit report obtained from a consumer reporting agency.
o Information related to any administrative, civil, or criminal findings by any
governmental jurisdiction.
Reminder: At any time, the regulatory authority may ask the NMLS to obtain state criminal
history background check information on applicants seeking licensure in the state.
How fingerprints are processed
Once the NMLS receives authorization to begin a background check of an applicant for a MLO
licensee, fingerprint images and related information are submitted electronically to the
Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ will confirm the existence and content of the following:
§ A record of state convictions
§ State arrests
§ Record of state arrests for which the DOJ establishes that the person is free on bail
§ An applicant’s recognizance pending trial or appeal
The DOJ will provide an electronic response to:
§ NMLS
§ Regulatory authority

The investigation may be limited to information that was not included in prior applications
filed with the division. If the regulatory authority does not find facts constituting reasons for
denial, it will issue and deliver a license to the applicant.

Grounds for Denying a License
The regulatory authority may deny a mortgage loan originator license application if the
applicant:
§ Has had a mortgage loan originator license revoked in any governmental jurisdiction,
(except that a subsequent formal vacation of a revocation will not be deemed a
revocation).
§ Has been convicted of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to; a felony in a domestic,
foreign, or military court during the seven-year period:
o preceding the date of the application for licensing and registration or;
o at any time preceding the date of application, if the felony involved an act of
fraud, dishonesty, or a breach of trust, or money laundering.
Felony crime classification
A specific crime is classified as a felony if it is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which
the individual is convicted to be a felony.
For example, assume an individual acquires marijuana in a state where purchasing and
consumption of marijuana is legal; however, while driving home this person is stopped by a
police officer in the state of Alabama where possession of the amount of marijuana is classified
as a felony. The felony conviction is based on Alabama law.
When applications may not be denied
There are two ways in which an applicant for a MLO license may receive approval and not be
denied by the regulatory authority. The applicant must:
§ Comply with all outlined application guidelines
§ Have felony conviction expunged or pardoned
Reminder: The regulatory authority may consider the underlying crime, facts, or circumstances
of an expunged or pardoned felony conviction when determining the eligibility of an applicant
for licensure.

Continuing Education Requirements
MLOs must complete continuing education annually as part of the process to renew their
license. Each year, a licensed MLO must complete at least eight (8) hours of continuing
education by December 31 each year. The continuing education must include at least the
following:
§ Three (3) hours of instruction on federal law and regulations
§ Two (2) hours of ethics, which includes instruction on fraud, consumer protection, and
fair lending issues
§ Two (2) hours of training related to lending standards for the nontraditional mortgage
product marketplace
§ One (1) hour of training related to relevant California law and regulations
CE course approval and delivery
Course providers are unable to deliver CE courses until NMLS reviews and approves them. This
also includes reviewing and approving the course provider.
An employer or affiliate by an agency contract or subsidiary of the employer of a MLO may
submit courses to the NMLS for approval that will enable the employer to teach its own
courses.
Delivery of continuing education courses may be offered via several formats:
§ Classroom
§ Online
§ By any other means approved by NMLS, including webinars
Course and credit guidelines
A licensed mortgage loan originator:
§ May only receive credit for a continuing education course in the year in which the
course is taken.
§ May not take the same approved course in the same or successive years to meet the
annual requirements for continuing education.
§ Will receive credit toward completion of continuing education requirements in
California from another state if NMLS approved the continuing education course.
Continuing education Instructor
A licensed MLO who is an approved instructor of an approved continuing education course
may receive credit for the licensed mortgage loan originator’s own annual continuing
education requirement at the rate of two hours of credit for every one hour taught.
CA-DFPI SAFE PE Course I Study Guide (v.04122023) Ameritrain. All Rights Reserved. Page 25 | 53
Unlicensed MLO
If a MLO becomes unlicensed for some reason, they must complete the continuing education
requirements for the last year in which the license was held prior to issuance of a new or
renewed license. If an individual that was previously licensed as a mortgage loan originator,
applies to be licensed again, then that person must prove that he or she has completed all the
continuing education requirements for the year in which the license was last held.
Renewal
Once you become a licensed MLO, licenses must be renewed on an annual basis between
November 1 and December 31. If a license is not renewed during those dates, it will be
considered lapsed or expired. Specifically, a MLO must:
§ Meet all continuing education requirements on or before December 31 of every year.
§ Continue to meet the minimum standards for license (see grounds for denying a
license).
§ Satisfy annual continuing education requirements (see continuing education
requirements).
§ Pay all required fees for renewal of the license (can be paid by the MLO, finance lender
or broker employing the MLO).
If an MLO fails to renew their license by December 31
The regulatory authority may adopt procedures for the reinstatement of expired licenses,
consistent with the standards established by the NMLS, if a license of a mortgage loan
originator fails to satisfy the minimum standards for license renewal by midnight on December
31.
Personal Information Updates and Required Notifications
Licensee and applicants can anticipate they will receive notifications for various items
associated with their license application or renewal status. In some cases, notification will be
given to the regulatory authority from background check or credit service providers once they
are complete.
§ The regulatory authority will request from the Department of Justice subsequent
arrest notification service from the Department of Justice fingerprint images and
related information based on fingerprints required by the Department of Justice for all
finance lender, broker license, and MLO candidates.
§ If the regulatory authority denies an application for a new location, then the licensee
has 10 days from the date of receipt of notification of the regulatory authority’s denial,
to submit a new application designating a different person responsible for the lending
activity at the new location. The regulatory authority can approve or deny alternative
person.
§ The regulatory authority may deny the application for a finance lender, broker and
MLO licenses for any number of reasons. If an applicant fails to respond to written
notification of a deficiency in the application within 90 days of the date of the
notification, then the application will be considered withdrawn.

Record Keeping and Reporting
Out of state requirements
If an entity chooses to apply for a license for a business location outside this state, it
automatically creates an agreement by the applicant to do all of the following:
§ Make the licensee’s books, accounts, papers, records, and files available to the
regulatory authority’s representatives in this state.
§ Pay the reasonable expenses for travel, meals, and lodging of the regulatory
authority’s representatives incurred during any investigation or examination made at
the licensee’s location outside this state.
A licensee located outside this state is not required to maintain books and records regarding
licensed loans separate from those for other loans, if the licensed loans can be readily
identified.

Additional requirements
Requirements for books and records that apply to finance lender, broker, and mortgage loan
originator licensees.
§ Keep and use in their business, books, accounts, and records which will enable the
regulatory authority to determine if the licensee is complying with the provisions of
this division and with the rules and regulations made by the regulatory authority.
§ Retain records and documents on any loan secured by real property in which loan
proceeds were disbursed to an independent escrow holder.
§ File an authorization for disclosure to the commissioner of financial records of the

Additional requirements (continued)
Licensees must require the maintenance or preservation of original records, provided that any
information requested by the regulatory authority can be furnished within 48 hours, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.
Licensees must:
Do: File an annual report with the regulatory authority
What: Provide relevant information that the regulatory authority reasonably requires
concerning the business and operations within the state during the preceding calendar
year for each licensed place of business.
When: On or before the 15th day of March
In addition to the annual report, a mortgage lender, mortgage broker, and mortgage lender
and broker will file the NMLS Mortgage Call Report. Every mortgage loan originator must
ensure that all residential mortgage loans that close as a result of his or her loan origination
activities are included in the NMLS Mortgage Call Report submitted to NMLS or the
Commissioner by his or her sponsoring mortgage lender, broker, or mortgage lender and
broker.
The regulatory authority may require:
§ a licensee (lender or broker) to make other special reports if required by the
regulatory authority.
§ a licensee (lender or broker) that employs one or more mortgage loan originators to
submit to the NMLS reports of condition, using any of the forms approved by the
regulatory authority.
§ a mortgage loan originator to submit reports of condition to the NMLS, instead of the
reports of condition required of his or her employer (lender or broker).
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50330]
Examinations
The authority to make or conduct any examination or investigation may be delegated by the
regulatory authority to any deputy, investigator, examiner, or auditor appointed for that
purpose. An individual appointed by the regulatory authority may:
§ Administer oaths
§ Subpoena witnesses
§ Take their testimony
The appointment will be made by an instrument in writing signed by the regulatory authority.
Upon any examination or investigation, the instrument must be produced by the appointed
individual at any time upon demand.

California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50329]
Control documents
In making an investigation or examination, the regulatory authority may, for a reasonable time
not exceeding 30 days, control access to any documents and records of the licensee pertaining
to the business of any residential mortgage lender or residential mortgage loan servicer.
The regulatory authority may place a keeper in exclusive charge of the documents and records
in the place where they are usually kept.
During the period of control, no director, officer, partner, or employee should remove or
attempt to remove any of the documents except pursuant to a court order or with the consent
of the regulatory authority. However, the directors, officers, partners, and employees of the
residential mortgage lender or residential mortgage loan servicer may examine the documents
or records.
The licensee’s employees will be permitted to make entries in the documents or records to
reflect current transactions. Unless the regulatory authority has reasonable grounds to believe
the documents or records of the licensee have been or are at risk of being altered or destroyed
for purposes of concealing a violation of this division, the licensee will have access to the
documents or records as necessary to conduct its ordinary business affairs.
The regulatory authority or any officer designated by the regulatory authority may administer
oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and
require the production of any documents or records that the regulatory authority deems
relevant.

Relationship with NMLS
As you probably suspect, the regulatory authority and the NMLS have a very close working
relationship. So much so that the regulatory authority is authorized to establish relationships
or contracts with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, or other entities
designated by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry to collect and maintain
records and process transaction fees or other fees related to licensees or other persons.
Specifically, the regulatory authority:
§ Is authorized to waive or modify any or all of the requirements of this division and to
establish new requirements as reasonably necessary to participate in the Nationwide
Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.
§ May use the NMLS as a channeling agent for requesting information from, and
distributing information to, the Department of Justice or any governmental agency
and any source directed by the regulatory authority.
CA-DFPI SAFE PE Course I Study Guide (v.04122023) Ameritrain. All Rights Reserved. Page 31 | 53
In addition, the regulatory authority may establish a process where applicants and licensees
may challenge information entered into the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and
Registry by the regulatory authority. Not that this will ever be a problem, but just in case.
Since the regulatory authority is authorized to participate in the NMLS, it will require mortgage
loan originators to be licensed and registered through the NMLS. To achieve this goal, the
regulatory authority may require the following:
§ Background information for the following:
o Criminal history through fingerprint or other databases
o Civil or administrative records
o Credit history
o Any other information as deemed necessary by the Nationwide Mortgage
Licensing System and Registry.
§ Payment of fees to apply for or renew licenses through the NMLS.
§ Setting or resetting as necessary of renewal or reporting dates.
§ Requirements for amending or surrendering a license or any other activities as the
regulatory authority deems necessary for participation in the NMLS.
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50301]
Power of the regulatory authority
The regulatory authority has been assigned by law the functions, powers, and duties to:
§ issue or refuse to issue a license.
§ revoke or suspend for cause any license.
§ keep records of licenses issued.
§ receive, consider, investigate, and act upon complaints made in connection with a
licensee.
§ prescribe the forms of and receive:
o applications for licenses;
o reports and books and records required to be made by a licensee, including
annual audited financial statements.
§ subpoena documents and witnesses and compel their attendance and production, to

o background
o honesty
o truthfulness
o integrity

Regulatory authority powers continued
They can deny, suspend, revoke, condition, or decline to renew a mortgage loan originator
license for a violation of this division:
§ if an applicant or licensee:
o makes a false statement of a material fact in the application;
o employs a mortgage loan originator who is not licensed, or has not initiated an
application to become licensed;
o withholds information or makes a material misstatement in an application for a
license or license renewal.
§ order restitution against a mortgage loan originator or any finance lender or broker
licensee employing a mortgage loan originator for a violation of this division.
§ impose fines on a mortgage loan originator or any finance lender or broker licensee
employing a mortgage loan originator that violates division rules.
§ issue orders or directives to mortgage loan originators or any finance lender or broker
licensee employing a mortgage loan originator under this division to:
o desist and refrain from conducting business, including immediate temporary
orders to desist and refrain;
o cease any harmful activities or violations of this division, including immediate
temporary orders to desist and refrain;
o enter immediate temporary orders to cease business if the regulatory authority
determines that the license was erroneously granted or the mortgage loan
originator is currently in violation of this division.
o and order or direct any other affirmative action as the regulatory authority deems
necessary.
Reminder: The regulatory authority oversees license entities, including mortgage loan
originators, can do everything within its power to enforce compliance with law to protect
California residents.

Suspension and Reinstatement
Let’s say a licensee decides to violate a couple of laws enforced by the DFPI, then you can
expect there will be a price to pay. The commissioner can suspend or bar a person for up to 12
months after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing. If any person is suspended or
barred, then they are prohibited from:
§ participating in any business activity of a licensed finance lender, broker, or mortgage
loan originator;
§ and engaging in any business activity on the premises where a licensed finance lender,
broker, or mortgage loan originator is conducting its business.
A suspended or barred person may have their personal transactions processed by a licensed
finance lender, broker, or mortgage loan originator.
10 CCR § 1422.10
Surrender of License
An application to surrender a license as a mortgage lender, mortgage broker, mortgage lender
and broker, or mortgage loan originator must be filed on Form(s) MU1, MU3, and MU4
through NMLS in accordance with its procedures for transmission to the Commissioner. Upon
approval of the surrender by the Commissioner, a licensee will amend every branch office
application Form MU3 and terminate the sponsorship of all mortgage loan originators.
To surrender a branch office license, a licensee must file an amendment to Form MU3 in
accordance with the instructions on the form for surrendering a branch office license.

Prohibited Conduct and Practices
Early sections of this course outlined licensing requirements and a lot of what you can do.
What follows is a list of prohibited acts.
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50507]
Any director, officer, partner, trustee, or employee of a licensee, its holding company, or its
affiliates who knowingly makes or concurs in making or publishing any false entry in its books
or records, any written report, exhibit, or statement of its affairs or pecuniary condition
containing any material statement which is false, or having the custody of its books, willfully
refuses or neglects to make any proper entry in the books as required by law or to allow the
books to be inspected by the regulatory authority or his or her deputies or investigators,
violates this division.
A finance lender or broker is prohibited from employing a mortgage loan originator whose
license or license endorsement has lapsed.
California Financing Law [CA Fin § 22100]
A finance lender or broker may not make or broker a residential mortgage loan unless that
loan is offered by, negotiated by, or applied for through a licensed mortgage loan originator.

the same level of transparency.
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50302]

will assess, the reasonable expenses of any examination of the licensee and affiliates.
10 CCR § 1414
Supervision of Mortgage Loan Originators
Every mortgage lender, mortgage broker, and mortgage lender and broker:
§ must exercise diligent supervision over the mortgage loan origination and lending
activities of every mortgage loan originator that it sponsors. Every mortgage loan
originator employed by a mortgage lender, mortgage broker, or mortgage lender and
broker will be subject to the supervision of a branch manager designated by such
mortgage lender, mortgage broker, or mortgage lender and broker. Every branch
manager must be identified on Form MU3 and will submit a Form MU2 to NMLS.

CA-DFPI SAFE PE Course I Study Guide (v.04122023) Ameritrain. All Rights Reserved. Page 38 | 53
The supervisor must be identified in Form MU1 as a qualifying individual and will submit a
Form MU2. For purposes of this section, a qualifying individual is a person in charge and
responsible for the actions of the mortgage lender, mortgage broker, and mortgage lender and
broker.
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50306]; 10 CCR § 1409.1
Change of control
Prior to a change of control of the business of a licensee, the person wishing to acquire control
must submit an application to the regulatory authority and pay an investigation fee of one
hundred dollars ($100). The $100 charge is for each day up to 10 days and ten dollars ($10) for
each day thereafter during which the branch office or changed locations is maintained without
notifying the commissioner.
Notice of Changes by Mortgage Lender, Mortgage Broker, Mortgage Lender
and Broker, and Mortgage Loan Originator
§ Upon any change in the information contained in a license application (other than
financial information contained therein) an amendment must be promptly filed,
setting forth the changed information.
§ Any changes to Forms MU1, MU2, and MU3, and any exhibits thereto, must be filed
through NMLS in accordance with its procedures for transmission to the
Commissioner. Any change that cannot be submitted through NMLS must be filed
directly with the Commissioner.
§ A mortgage loan originator will file changed information contained in its Form MU4,
and any exhibits thereto, through NMLS in accordance with its procedures for
transmission to the Commissioner within twenty (20) days of changes to the
information. Any change that cannot be submitted through NMLS will be filed directly
with the Commissioner. A mortgage loan originator may not renew his or her license
until all changes to the information contained in his or her Form MU4 are filed with
the Commissioner.
§ A licensed mortgage lender, mortgage broker, and mortgage lender and broker must
notify the Commissioner of the employment of any new mortgage loan originator and
of the termination of employment of any mortgage loan originator in California.
§ If a mortgage lender, mortgage broker, or mortgage lender and broker discovers that a
sponsored mortgage loan originator has not filed an amendment to his or her Form
MU4, the mortgage lender, mortgage broker, or mortgage lender and broker will
require the mortgage loan originator to file the amendment immediately. If, within
five (5) days from the demand, the mortgage loan originator has not made the
changes, the mortgage lender, mortgage broker, or mortgage lender and broker must
inform the Commissioner in writing.

Disclosures and Agreements
As you can imagine, not everything you disclose to the NMLS should be shared with the public
or entities that should not have access to your personal information. The regulatory authority
must abide by specific confidentiality requirements to protect your interest.
Confidentiality
§ The regulatory authority is authorized to enter agreements or share arrangements
with other governmental agencies, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the
American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators, or other associations
representing governmental agencies as established by rule, regulation, or order of the
regulatory authority.
§ Information or material that is subject to a privilege or confidentiality will not be
subject to the following:
o Disclosure under any federal or state law governing the disclosure to the public of
information held by an officer or an agency of the federal government or the state.
o Subpoena or discovery, or admission into evidence, in any private civil action or
administrative process, unless with respect to any privilege held by the Nationwide
Mortgage Licensing System and Registry with respect to the information or
material, the person to whom the information or material pertains waives, in
whole or in part, in the discretion of the person, that privilege.
o Will not apply with respect to the information or material relating to the
employment history of, and publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement
actions against, mortgage loan originators that is included in the Nationwide
Mortgage Licensing System and Registry for access by the public.
Reminder: While there is a Consumer Access page located on the NMLS website where
consumers can confirm that the financial-services company or licensed professional with
whom they wish to conduct business is authorized to conduct business in their state, there is a
limit of the type of information that can the public can access. No personal information, such
as home address, personal telephone number, or criminal records is available through this free
portal.

Advertising
While some might agree that all publicity is good, not everything should be shared. Here are
several advertising guidelines you should know to keep out of trouble.
No person should do any of the following:
§ Make a materially false or misleading statement or representation to a borrower
about the terms or conditions of that borrower’s loan, when making or brokering the
loan.
§ Advertise, print, display, publish, distribute, or broadcast, or cause or permit to be
advertised, printed, displayed, published, distributed, or broadcast in any manner, any
statement or representation with regard to the business subject to the provisions of
this division, including the rates, terms, or conditions for making or negotiating loans,
that is false, misleading, or deceptive, or that omits material information that is
necessary to make the statements not false, misleading, or deceptive, or in the case of
a licensee, that refers to the supervision of the business by the state or any
department or official of the state.
§ Knowingly misrepresent, circumvent, or conceal, through subterfuge or device, any
material aspect or information regarding a transaction to which the person is a party.
§ Commit an act that constitutes fraud or dishonest dealings.
No licensee can place an advertisement disseminated primarily in this state for a loan unless
the licensee discloses in the printed text of the advertisement, or in the oral text in the case of
a radio or television advertisement, the license under which the loan would be made or
arranged.
A finance company must maintain in its home office, a file of all advertising copy for a period
of at least two (2) years after the last date of its use. All advertising copy must have the name
or names of all advertising media used and the dates when such advertising appeared. In the
case of radio or television advertising, unless the full text of such announcements is retained
by the broadcasting station or stations and is available to the commissioner, a finance
company will cause a voice transcription of the full text of such announcements to be
prepared and retained for two (2) years after the last date of its use.
Any advertising used by a mortgage loan originator must be maintained by the sponsoring
mortgage lender, mortgage broker, or mortgage lender and broker, in the manner set forth in
this section. For purposes of this section, a finance company includes mortgage loan
originators.
The regulatory authority may require that rates of charge, rates of interest, charges, and costs
of loans, if stated by a licensee, be stated fully and clearly in the manner that it deems
necessary to prevent misunderstanding by prospective borrowers. If the rates or costs
CA-DFPI SAFE PE Course I Study Guide (v.04122023) Ameritrain. All Rights Reserved. Page 41 | 53
advertised do not apply to loans of all classes made or negotiated by the person, this fact must
be clearly indicated in the advertisement.
What happens if the regulatory authority disapproves an advertising copy? The ad copy cannot
be used, and the licensee will be notified in writing of the disapproval. Also, the regulatory
authority may direct any licensee to submit advertising copy to it for review prior to use. The
regulatory authority may require licensees to maintain a file of all advertising copy for a period
of two years from the date of its use. The file must be made available to the regulatory
authority upon request.
“Guaranteed loan offer” as used in this section means an offer by a finance company that
purports to be a firm offer or guarantee or commitment that the finance company will make a
loan to the individual or individuals named in the offer. A finance company is not permitted to
make a guaranteed loan offer unless the following conditions are met:
§ The complete offer package and any related advertising copy (the “Package”) have
been submitted to the Commissioner for examination and the Commissioner has
notified the company in writing that the use of the Package is not disapproved.
§ The finance company makes the offer to an individual or individuals specifically named
in the offer. The finance company may require each individual so named in the offer to
be obligated on the loan.
§ The finance company expressly agrees to make a loan or loans of any stated amount
or amounts (or up to a definitely stated or determinable maximum amount or
amounts) at a rate or rates not to exceed a stated annual percentage rate or rates,
upon presentation of the offer, and without any credit investigation.
§ The finance company expressly agrees to make the loan without security or to make a
loan secured by personal property without considering the value of or insuring the
security.
§ The offer is dated accurately as of the date of issue and contains a termination date
effective not more than 12 months from the date of issuance by the finance company.
§ The offer is not a facsimile of a check, draft, bond, insurance policy, or any other form
of commercial paper, which would tend to be false, misleading or deceptive.
§ The offer clearly shows that a loan and repayment thereof, together with charges
thereon, is involved.
§ The offer specifies the location at which the loan will be made.
§ The offer specifies that the finance company's loans are made pursuant to a California
Finance Lenders license.
A guaranteed loan offer may contain any of the following provisions:
§ The finance company will honor the offer only if the prospective borrower or
borrowers does not have a current loan balance outstanding with the finance
company.
§ The prospective borrower or borrowers will be required to choose between all
outstanding guaranteed loan offers.
§ The finance company will honor the offer only if the prospective borrower or
borrowers agrees to combine the offered loan with the current loan balance
outstanding with the finance company.
CA-DFPI SAFE PE Course I Study Guide (v.04122023) Ameritrain. All Rights Reserved. Page 42 | 53
“Blind” advertisements are prohibited. “Blind” advertising is an advertisement used to solicit
business that gives only a telephone number, post office or newspaper box number, or name
other than that of the licensee. For purposes of this section, a licensee includes a mortgage
loan originator.
§ 1026.24(i)(2)
Misrepresentations about government endorsement
It is prohibited to make any statement in an advertisement that the product offered is a
“government loan program”, “government-supported loan”, or is otherwise endorsed or
sponsored by any Federal, state, or local government entity, unless the advertisement is for an
FHA loan, VA loan, or similar loan program that is, in fact, endorsed or sponsored by a Federal,
state, or local government entity.
Reminder: Advertising is an area that is governed under federal law, primarily under the Truth-
in-Lending Act, and at the state level. It is important that licensees ensure they are compliant
both governing bodies to avoid penalties or fines.

California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50202]
Escrow Account and Loan Requirements
Escrow funds for a residential mortgage loan contract must be maintained in a depository
institution and may not be commingled with a licensee’s funds. A trust account will be placed
in a non-interest-bearing account in a federally insured depository institution, a federal home
loan bank, a federal reserve bank, or other similar government-sponsored enterprise, to be
removed and used only for the following:
§ Payments authorized by the borrower, allowed by the mortgage loan contract, or
required by federal or state law.
§ Refunds to the borrower.
§ Transfer to another institution.
§ Forwarding to the appropriate servicer in case of a transfer of servicing.
§ Any other purpose authorized by the residential mortgage loan contract.
§ Compliance with a regulatory or court order.
Trust funds
“Trust funds” are funds collected by a licensee during the making or servicing of a residential
mortgage loan that the licensee holds on behalf of another. Benefits accruing from the
placement in a non-interest-bearing account of a commercial bank (including a national
banking association) of funds received by a licensee, will profit the licensee, unless otherwise
agreed in writing by the licensee and the investor on whose behalf the licensee services the
loan. A borrower will receive at least 2 percent simple interest per annum on impound account
payments covered by Section 2954.8 of the Civil Code.
Trust funds are not subject to the enforcement of a money judgment arising out of a claim
against the licensee or person acting as the servicing agent, and in no instance, will the trust
funds be considered or treated as an asset of the licensee or person performing the functions
of a residential mortgage lender or loan servicer.
A licensee may, at the request of the owner of the trust funds, transfer the funds initially
deposited in a non-interest-bearing trust account into an interest-bearing account in a
federally insured depository institution if all of the following requirements are met:
§ The account is in the name of the residential mortgage lender licensee in trust for the
specified beneficiary.
§ All of the funds in the account are federally insured.
§ The funds in the account are kept separate and distinct from the funds of the licensee
or funds of any other person for whom the licensee holds funds in trust.
§ The licensee discloses to the person from whom the funds are received and the
beneficiary of the account how interest will be calculated and paid, whether service
charges will be paid to the depository and by whom, and possible notice requirements
or penalties for withdrawal of funds from the account.
§ All interest earned on the account will be paid to the owner of the trust funds or the
beneficiary.

SECTION: DISCIPLINARY ACTION
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50516]
Notifications, Hearings, and Appeals
For any licensee, a disciplinary action taken by the State of California, another state, any
agency of the federal government, or another country for any action substantially related to
the activity regulated under this law may be a ground for disciplinary action by the regulatory
authority. A certified copy of the record of the disciplinary action will be conclusive evidence of
the events.
Suspension, Revocations, and Rescission of Licenses
The subject of suspension, revocation, and rescission of licenses is clearly serious which is why
we want you to pay close attention as you review the details of this section.
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50205]
Applies to residential mortgage lenders and servicers:
Failure to file a new bond within 10 days of the recovery on a bond, or within 10 days after
notification by the regulatory authority that a new bond is required, constitutes sufficient
grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license.
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50318]
The regulatory authority may, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, by order:
§ Censure or suspend for a period not exceeding 12 months, or
§ Bar from any position of employment, management, or control any residential
mortgage lender, residential mortgage loan servicer, or mortgage loan originator, or
any other person, if the regulatory authority finds either of the following:
o That the censure, suspension, or bar is in the public interest and the violation:
• Was either known or should have been known by the person committing or
causing it, or
CA-DFPI SAFE PE Course I Study Guide (v.04122023) Ameritrain. All Rights Reserved. Page 45 | 53
• Has caused material damage to the residential mortgage lender, residential
mortgage loan servicer, mortgage loan originator, or to the public.
o That the person:
• Has been convicted of or pleaded nolo contendere to any crime, or
• Has been held liable in any civil action by final judgment, or any administrative
judgment by any public agency
Within 15 days from the date of a notice of intention to issue an order, the person may
request a hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act. Upon receiving a request, the
matter will be set for hearing to commence within 30 days after receipt, unless the person
consents to a later date.
If no hearing is requested within 15 days after the mailing or service of the notice and none is
ordered by the regulatory authority, the failure to request a hearing will constitute a waiver of
the right to a hearing.
After receiving a notice of intention to issue an order, the person is immediately prohibited
from engaging in any activities subject to licensure under the law.
Persons suspended or barred are prohibited from:
§ Participating in any business activity of a licensed residential mortgage lender,
residential mortgage loan servicer, or mortgage loan originator
§ Engaging in any business activity on the premises where a licensed residential
mortgage lender, residential mortgage loan servicer, or mortgage loan originator is
conducting its business.
This section will apply to any violation, conviction, plea, or judgment after the enactment of
this section.
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50320]
Whenever, in the opinion of the regulatory authority, a person is engaged in the business of:
§ Making residential mortgage loans, servicing residential mortgage loans
§ Engaging in business as a mortgage loan originator, without a license from the
regulatory authority, may result in an order for the person to desist and refrain.
If, within 30 days after an order is served, a request for a hearing is filed in writing and the
hearing is not held within 60 days of the filing, the order is rescinded.

California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50321]
If, after investigation, the regulatory authority has reasonable grounds to believe that any
licensee has violated its articles of incorporation or any law or rule, it will, by written order
addressed to the licensee, direct the discontinuance of the violation. The order will be
effective immediately,
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50322]
If, after investigation, the regulatory authority has reasonable grounds to believe that any
licensee is conducting business in an unsafe or injurious manner, it will direct the
discontinuance of the unsafe or injurious practices. The order will be effective immediately.
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50323]
The licensee has 10 days after an order is made final to commence an action to restrain
enforcement of the order. If the enforcement of the order is not enjoined within 10 days by
the court in which the action is brought, the licensee must comply with the order.
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50324]
If, after investigation, the regulatory authority has reasonable grounds to believe that any
person has engaged or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any
provision of this division or any rule, it may:
§ Bring an action to enjoin the acts or practices.
§ Enforce compliance with this law or any rule or order.
The action will be brought in the name of the people of the State of California in the superior
court. Upon a proper showing, a permanent or preliminary injunction, restraining order, or
writ of mandate will be granted.
A receiver, monitor, conservator, or other designated fiduciary or officer of the court, which
may include the regulatory authority, may be appointed for the defendant or the defendant’s
assets. Any other ancillary relief may be granted as appropriate.
CA-DFPI SAFE PE Course I Study Guide (v.04122023) Ameritrain. All Rights Reserved. Page 47 | 53
A receiver, monitor, conservator, or other designated fiduciary or officer of the court
appointed by the superior court pursuant to this section may, with the approval of the court,
exercise any or all of the powers of the defendant’s officers, directors, partners, trustees, or
persons who exercise similar powers and perform similar duties. The powers include the filing
of a petition for bankruptcy. No action at law or in equity may be maintained by any party
against the regulatory authority, or a receiver, monitor, conservator, or other designated
fiduciary or officer of the court, by reason of their exercising these powers or performing these
duties pursuant to the order of, or with the approval of, the superior court.
If the regulatory authority determines it is in the public interest, it may include in any action a
claim for ancillary relief. The ancillary relief may include, but not be limited to, restitution or
disgorgement or damages on behalf of the persons injured by the act or practice constituting
the subject matter of the action. The court will have jurisdiction to award additional relief.
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50325]
The regulatory authority may immediately revoke the residential mortgage lender’s;
residential mortgage loan servicer’s; or mortgage loan originator’s license if the licensee fails
to comply with any order issued under Section 50318, 50319, 50321, 50322, or 50503. The
regulatory authority will not revoke the license if, within 10 days from the effective date of the
revocation order, the licensee secures a court order restraining the enforcement of the
regulatory authority’s revocation order.
California Residential Mortgage Lending Act [CA Fin § 50326]
If any licensee fails to do any of the following, the licensee forfeits to the people of the state a
sum of up to one hundred dollars ($100) for every day up to the 10th day:
§ To make any report required by law or by the regulatory authority within 10 days from
the day designated for the making of the report, or within any extension of time
granted by the regulatory authority, or
§ Fails to include therein any matter required by law or by the regulatory authority.
Thereafter, any failure will constitute grounds for the suspension or revocation of the license
held by the residential mortgage lender or residential mortgage loan servicer.
CA-DFPI SAFE PE Course I Study Guide (v.04122023) Ameritrain. All Rights Reserved. Page 48 | 53

§ The regulatory authority may, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard,
deny, decline to renew, suspend, or revoke any license if it finds that:
o The licensee has violated any provision of this division or any rule or order of the
regulatory authority thereunder.
§ Any fact or condition exists that, if it had existed at the time of the original application
for the license, reasonably would have warranted the regulatory authority in refusing
to issue the license originally.
Failure to Obey a Subpoena
(Applies to a director, officer, partner, or employee of a licensee)
In case of refusal to obey a subpoena issued to a licensee, the superior court may issue an
order requiring that person to appear before the regulatory authority. When before the
regulatory authority, licensee must produce documentary evidence or give evidence on the
matter under investigation. Failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the
court as contempt.
No person is excused from testifying or from producing any document or record before the
regulatory authority, on the grounds that the testimony or evidence required by the regulatory
authority may tend to incriminate the person or subject him or her to a penalty or forfeiture.
However, no individual may be penalized for any matter concerning which he or she is
compelled to testify or produce evidence, after validly claiming the privilege against self-
incrimination. However, individual testimony is not exempt from prosecution and punishment
for perjury or contempt committed in testifying.
California Financing Law [CA Fin § 22168]
The regulatory authority may, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, suspend
for a period not to exceed 12 months or bar a person from any position of employment with a
licensee if it finds that the person has willfully used or claimed without authority a designation
or certification of special education, practice, or skill that the person has not attained, or
willfully held out to the public a confusingly similar designation or certification for the purpose
of misleading the public regarding his or her qualifications or experience.

a reasonable time period or periods by which the violation or violations must be corrected.
In addition, each citation may assess an administrative fine not to exceed two thousand five
hundred dollars ($2,500) that will be deposited in the State Corporations Fund. In assessing a
fine, the regulatory authority will give due consideration to the appropriateness of the amount
of the fine with respect to factors including the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the
person or licensees cited, and the history of previous violations.

A citation issued and a fine assessed, while constituting punishment for a violation of law, will
be provided instead of other administrative discipline by the regulatory authority for the
offense or offenses cited, and the citation and fine payment thereof by a licensee will not be
reported as disciplinary action taken by the regulatory authority.
The regulatory authority may issue an order to:
§ Desist and refrain from engaging in a specific business or activity or activities, or
§ Suspend all business operations to a person or licensee who is engaged in or who has
engaged in continued or repeated violations of this division.
In any of these circumstances, the sanctions authorized will be separate from, and in addition
to, all other administrative, civil, or criminal remedies.
If, within 30 days from the receipt of the citation, the person cited fails to notify the
department of their intent to request a hearing, the citation will be deemed final.
After the exhaustion of the review procedures, the regulatory authority may apply to the
appropriate superior court for:
§ A judgment in the amount of the administrative fine and
§ An order compelling the cited person to comply with the order of the regulatory
authority.
The application, which will include a certified copy of the final order of the regulatory
authority, will constitute a sufficient showing to warrant the issuance of the judgment and
order.
It is a violation of this division for any person to:
§ Make any untrue statement of a material fact in any document filed with the
regulatory authority.
§ Omit any material fact which is required to be stated in any document.
