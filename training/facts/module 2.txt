TOPIC: DEFINITIONS
The following terms are important to know for this module and will help you improve your mortgage
vocabulary and knowledge of the universe of real estate financing. Be sure to memorize these terms to
improve your exam scores.
Debt to Income Your debt-to-income ratio is all your recurring monthly debt payments divided by
Ratio your gross monthly income. (Example: $2,000 debt / $6,000 income = 33% DTI).
This number is one way that lenders measure your ability to manage the
payments you make every month to repay the money you have borrowed.
Index A market instrument that varies with market conditions. Rates tied to an index
can adjust based on the changes in the index.
Margin The lender’s profit which is added to the index to determine the rate which is
referred to as the par rate or the fully indexed rate.
Fully Indexed An interest rate based on the index and the margin.
Rate
Default The failure of the borrower to meet their legal obligation and the conditions of
the loan.
ARM Reset Adjustable-rate mortgages periodically adjust based on the index at the end of a
fixed rate period (in the case of a Hybrid ARM). The change in the rate is known
as an ARM ‘reset’.
Points Fees paid directly to the lender at closing in exchange for a reduced interest rate.
(Discount This act of paying the fees is also known as ‘buying down the rate’. Lower rates
Points) can equal lower monthly payments. A point is equal to 1% of your loan amount
(or $1,000 for every $100,000).
Safe Harbor As it relates to this section it means if the lender meets certain conditions the
lender is protected from potential liability. Unsafe harbor means the lender is
open to liability and the courts will decide the outcome.

APR (Annual The true cost of financing. The amount financed and the cost to finance is
Percentage reflected in the Annual Percentage Rate.
Rate)
APOR (Average The average of all Annual Percentage Rates (e.g., interest rates, fees, other
Prime Offer terms) for prime borrowers in the US for the previous week, published the next
Rate) week.
Jumbo Loan A jumbo mortgage is a home loan for an amount that exceeds
conforming loan limits established by regulation. The conforming loan limit in
most areas is $726,200. This amount is subject to change annually.

TOPIC: ABILITY TO REPAY AND QUALIFIED
MORTGAGE RULE
ABILITY TO REPAY RULE
The Ability to Repay rule requires MLO organizations to make a good faith determination about whether
the borrower has the capacity to meet loan terms.
Key Points 8 factors to consider in making the determination:
▪ Income and Assets (excludes value of property securing the loan)
▪ Employment status
▪ Mortgage payments considering fully indexed rate or introductory rate
(whichever is higher)
▪ Fully amortized payments (payments that will pay off the loan)
▪ Simultaneous loans on same dwelling
▪ Monthly payments for taxes, insurance, and homeowner assoc. fees
▪ Current debt obligations including alimony, child support and:
o Installment debt (i.e., cars, appliances, etc.)
o Revolving debt (i.e., credit cards, etc.)
o Existing mortgages not being paid off
o Debt-to-income ratio and residual income
▪ Credit history
QUALIFIED MORTGAGES
Lenders have the option to originate a qualified mortgage loan.
More information can be found in the Qualified Mortgage brochure. All rights reserved.
http://ameritrain.tiltlms.com/uploads/ebook/play/QualifiedMortgageBrochure.pdf
Key Points Types of Qualified Mortgages:
▪ Can be originated by all lenders.
o General
o Seasoned
▪ Note: can be originated by small creditors operating primarily in rural
areas
o Small Creditor
o Balloon
Features and Limitations
▪ No negative amortization
o Interest portion of the payment must be covered
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 10 | 40
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
▪ No interest only
o A portion of the payment must be allocated to principal
▪ No balloon payments
▪ Income and assets relied upon for repayment is verified and documented
▪ Points and fee thresholds change yearly. Currently for a maximum loan
term of 30 years the following fees apply (For 2023):
Points/Fees Loan Amount
Limited to 3% ≥ $ $124,331
$ 3,750 ≥ $ 74,599 and < $ 124,331
5% ≥ $ 24,866 and < $ 74,599
$ 1,243 ≥ $ 15,541 and < $ 24,866
8% ≤ $ 15,541
Key Points Underwriting Requirements:
These vary by the type of mortgage. See below.
General Mortgage Underwriting Requirements:
▪ Must qualify borrower using the maximum rate potential within first five
years:
o If the rate has the potential to increase that maximum rate must
be used to qualify
▪ Limits based on the loan's pricing
▪ For first liens with loan amounts ≥ $124,331, the annual
percentage rate (APR) may not exceed the average prime offer
rate (APOR) for a comparable transaction by 2.25 or more
percentage points as of the date the interest rate is set.
▪ Loans must meet a full amortization schedule:
o The qualifying payment must be the payment that will pay off the
loan by the loan’s due date
Seasoned Qualified Mortgage Underwriting Requirements:
Criteria for a Seasoned QM In order to become eligible to become a seasoned QM
and receive a safe harbor from ATR liability at the end of the 36-month seasoning
period, the loan must meet the following criteria:
▪ Secured by a first lien with a maximum 30-year loan term
▪ Has a fixed rate, with regular equal periodic payments, fully amortizing and
no balloon payments
▪ Is not subject to the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act
▪ Points and fees do not exceed the 3% threshold (or other applicable limit)
▪ Creditor must consider the consumer’s debt-to-income ratio or residual
income, income or assets, other than the value of the dwelling, and debts,
and verify the consumer’s income or assets, other than the value of the
dwelling, and the consumer’s debts, using the same consider and verify
requirements established for general QMs in the general QM rule.
▪ Creditor must hold the loan for the entire 36- month seasoning period.
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 11 | 40
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
▪ There must have been no more than two delinquencies of 30 or more days
and no delinquencies of 60 or more days at the end of the seasoning period
Small Creditor / Balloon Qualified Mortgages Underwriting Requirements:
Only lenders that meet the asset and loan activity criteria are eligible to provide
these categories of qualified mortgages. The following is a sample of the criteria:
▪ Loans must have a fixed interest rate
▪ Loan term is 5 years or longer
▪ The small lender must hold the loan for three years unless selling the loan
to another small lender
▪ More than 50 percent of mortgages originated must be secured by
properties designated as rural or underserved. (Note: Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau publishes this list.)
HIGHER PRICED MORTGAGE LOANS (HPML)
Higher Priced Mortgage Loans (HPML) are loans that allow interest rates to exceed a predetermined
threshold based on the Average Prime Offer Rate and a fixed interest rate standard. This allows the
borrower to challenge if the Ability to Repay determination was met.
Key Points Determining HPML Loans:
A loan with a locked rate is a HPML if the APOR is exceeded as follows:
Loan Exceeds APOR By ___%
1st lien loan Exceeds APOR By 1.5%
1st jumbo loan Exceeds APOR By 2.5%
2nd lien loan Exceeds APOR By 3.5%
Example:
A lender offered a borrower a qualified mortgage for $200,000 at 5.5% on a first
lien. At the time the loan was locked the APOR was 4%. This is a HPML loan
because the rate offered exceeds the APOR by 1.5% for a first lien loan. The
borrower would be able to challenge in court that the ATR was not met.
Loan Current Rate Exceeded
APOR offered Rate
1st lien loan 4% 5.5% By 1.5%
NON-QUALIFIED MORTGAGES
These are mortgages that meet the Ability to Repay requirement; however, they are allowed to have
risky features, such as negative amortization, interest only, terms greater than 30 years and fees that
exceed the QM threshold. Due to the risk involved, non-Qualified Mortgage loans typically carry higher
interest rates and less favorable terms.

SAFE HARBOR AND NON-SAFE HARBOR LOANS
Key Points Safe Harbor Loans
If a consumer closes on a loan that is a qualified mortgage and is not a Higher
Priced Mortgage loan, then the consumer is in the Safe Harbor region. This means
there is the presumption that the QM meets ATR requirements, and the loan
cannot be challenged.
If the annual percentage rate (APR) does not exceed the average prime offer rate
(APOR) for a comparable transaction by 1.5 percentage points or more as of the
date the interest rate is set. The loan is considered Safe.
Non-Safe Harbor Loans
Qualified mortgage loans that are Higher Priced Mortgage Loans (HPML) are open
for dispute. The consumer can challenge in court (rebut the presumption) that the
qualified mortgage meets the Ability to Repay requirements. The court will then
decide the outcome.
A first-lien loan receives a “rebuttable presumption” that the consumer had the
ability to repay if the APR exceeds the APOR for a comparable transaction by 1.5
percentage points or more but by less than 2.25 percentage points. The loan is
considered non-Safe.

TOPIC: MORTGAGE LOAN APPLICATION
UNIFORM RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOAN APPLICATION (URLA)
The application for a residential mortgage loan is known as a Uniform Residential Mortgage Loan
Application, URLA for short. There are 2 versions, the Fannie Mae form 1003, and the Freddie Mac form

▪ FH Act (The Fair Housing Act)
▪ HMDA (Home Mortgage Development Act)
▪ TRID [TILA (Truth in Lending Act) / RESPA (Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act)]
Nine Sections of the Application Form
▪ Section 1: Borrower Information
o This section is used to document a borrower’s personal
information, income and employment.
▪ Section 2: Financial Information – Assets and Liabilities
o This section is used to collect information about an
applicant’s financial assets, personal financial obligations
and debts they owe.
▪ Section 3: Financial Information – Real Estate
o This section is used to capture information about property
owned, and the debts and expenses related to the property.

property or housing” and violations by the MLO interviewer
are referred to as “fraud for profit”.
o It is prohibited for an MLO to have a borrower sign a loan
application with blank spaces to be filled in at a later date.
o Once an MLO has been exposed to information, the MLO is
bound to disclose the information unless it is prohibited by
law. Not to disclose information is fraud and could cause the
lender to make a loan or offer particular loan terms that the
lender would not have made if it had known information
that was not disclosed.
o This is also the signature section of the URLA.
▪ Section 7: Military Service
o Section used to collect information about a borrower’s (or
deceased spouse’s) military service.

originator
o Includes the signature, name, and telephone number of the
MLO, the NMLS unique identifier number of the MLO and
the MLO’s company, and the NMLS company’s unique
identifier number and address.

FANNIE MAE UNDERWRITING REQUIREMENTS
The industry has adopted the Fannie Mae eligibility requirements that must be met for the loan to be
purchased by Fannie Mae as the basis for all loan programs, with some exceptions. Since Fannie
purchases FHA, VA, and USDA loans, these programs must meet the Fannie Mae eligibility requirements
to be eligible for purchase. The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting requirements are the
standard for conventional conforming loans.
Key Points Refer to the Fannie Mae Underwriting Matrix that is available for download from
the course Resources section or by visiting the Fannie Mae website (for

TOPIC: EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT
ECOA CFR 1002
The ECOA makes it unlawful for creditors to discriminate against an applicant based on their race, sex,
marital status, origin, or age provided they meet the standard of creditworthiness. The CFR 1002
regulation code is one of many included in the ECOA.
Key Points Purpose
▪ Promotes the availability of credit to all creditworthy applicants.
▪ Prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national
origin, sex, marital status, age, receipt of public assistance, or good faith
exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
▪ Requires creditors to provide applicants, upon request, with the reasons
underlying decisions to deny credit.
▪ Applicants must get a copy of all appraisals and other written valuations
used in connection with the applicant’s application for first lien loans
secured by a dwelling.
Creditor Requirements
▪ To notify applicants of action taken on their applications.
▪ To report credit history in the names of both spouses on an account.
▪ To retain records of credit applications.
▪ To collect information about the applicant's race and other personal
characteristics in applications for certain dwelling-related loans for
monitoring and federal law purposes.
▪ To provide applicants with copies of appraisal reports used in connection
with credit transactions.
A Completed Application
ECOA allows the lender to establish when an application is taken. It must be a
consistent policy for the organization. It may vary by lender.
Most lenders look to the TRID version of an application which is the official trigger
for many disclosures. This version determines that an application has been
received if the following 6 items are received.
▪ A – address of property
▪ L – loan amount
▪ I – income
▪ E – estimated value

creditworthiness of similarly qualified applicants for a similar type and amount of
credit, in evaluating an applicant's creditworthiness a creditor may consider:

that tends to indicate the credit history being considered by the creditor
does not accurately reflect the applicant's creditworthiness; and

account reported in the name of the applicant's spouse or former spouse
that the applicant can demonstrate accurately reflects the applicant's
creditworthiness.

Redlining
You may not make a geographical decision not to lend in a particular area. A
violation of ECOA occurs because the credit may become unavailable to all credit
worthy applicants that may reside in that area.
Reverse redlining is a violation of ECOA when a geographic area is targeted
because it may have a high percentage of credit challenged consumers and the
creditor targets the area for purposes of predatory and abusive lending practices.

TOPIC: FH ACT
FAIR HOUSING ACT (as amended) (Title VIII of the 1968 Civil Rights Act) Sec. 800. [42 U.S.C. 3601 note]
Short Title This title may be cited as the "Fair Housing Act". Sec. 801. [42 U.S.C. 3601]
ABOUT
Key Points General
▪ Also known as Title VIII of the Civil Rights act of 1968
▪ The Department of Housing and Development (HUD) is responsible for the
enforcement of the Fair Housing Act
▪ Since HUD is also responsible for the Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
the Fair Housing Act is referred to as the FH Act to avoid confusion
▪ Congress passed this act to address the problem of unlawful
discrimination in housing based on a number of prohibited factors
DEFINITIONS
Important definitions used in FH Act.
Blockbusting The practice of realtors using scare methods to get homeowners to sell their
properties at a deflated price by telling them that members of a particular class,
race, nationality or color, are moving into their neighborhood and that they
should sell before their home values drop. Although lending professionals are
typically not directly involved in this scheme, it is important for mortgage loan
originators to understand the practice and avoid being a beneficiary of the illegal
activity.
Familiar A protected class added to the FH Act in 1988. This protection against housing
Status discrimination applies to any person who is pregnant or in the process of securing
legal custody of any individual who is under the age of 18 including the person
under the age of 18. Discrimination of this nature applies to refusing housing
opportunities because of the existence or likely existence of children occupying
the premises.
Handicap Another protected class added to the FH Act in 1988. A person with a physical or
mental impairment which substantially limits the capacity of that individual to
navigate one or more major life activities. Handicap does not include a person
addicted to a controlled substance such as a heroin addict.
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 32 | 40
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
Redlining The discriminatory practice of lenders deciding not to make loans in certain
geographic areas because the lender has concluded that these areas are high-risk.
The offensive aspect of this practice relates to the fact that frequently the
redlined areas involve portions of the city inhabited by minority group members.
The illegal aspect of this practice is that credit worthy residents within the area
are denied access to loans for housing because of redlining.
Reverse The illegal practice of targeting residents within a particular geographic location
Redlining for predatory lending practices because they are potentially high-risk borrowers.
Steering A potential customer is either encouraged or discouraged from purchasing
housing in a particular area or community because of the agent's actions or
lender’s actions. This is a violation of the FH Act because the customer has the
right to full access and this right should not be interfered with based on a
prohibited basis.
SEC. 805. [42 U.S.C. 3605]
Regulations related to discriminatory practices.

o religion
o sex
o handicap,
o familial status
o national origin

have some common elements to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)
however there are some differences:
▪ Common to both acts:
o Race
o Color
o National Origin
o Sex
o Religion
▪ Unique to FH Act:
o Handicap
o Familiar status

TOPIC: Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)
12 U.S. Code Chapter 29 - HOME MORTGAGE DISCLOSURE
ABOUT
The last of the three fair lending laws is the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act HMDA.
Key Points HMDA’s purposes are to:
▪ Provide the public and public officials with sufficient information to enable
them to:
o Determine whether institutions are serving the housing needs of
the communities and neighborhoods in which they are located
o Assist public officials in distributing public sector investments in a
manner designed to improve the private investment environment
o Assist in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and
enforcing anti-discrimination statutes
Patterns of discrimination:
▪ Unlike the other fair lending laws, looks for patterns of discrimination vs.
against any single person.
▪ Financial institutions collect various types of information from consumers
in the course of processing loan applications.
Regulation C:
▪ HMDA and Regulation C require financial institutions to compile and
report to regulators some of this information and other information
obtained or generated concerning the application or loan.
Reminder Important:
Regulation C requires institutions to report lending data to their supervisory
agencies on a loan-by-loan and application-by-application basis by way of a
“register” reporting format. This vehicle is referred to as the HMDA Loan
Application Register, the LAR, or the register. The report is due by March 1 of the
following year.

TWO INSTITUTIONAL CATEGORIES
HMDA covers two categories of financial institutions.
Key Points Depository – banks, credit unions, savings and loan institutions
Non-depository – lenders, brokers
COLLECTION OF DATA
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) allows lenders to collect the data for monitoring purposes
under HMDA.
Key Points Loan information:
For each application or loan, institutions are required to:
▪ Identify the purpose (home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing),
lien status
▪ Whether the property relating to the loan or loan application is to be
owner-occupied as a principal dwelling.
Application information:
▪ Institutions must report the following data for applications and originated
loans (reporting this data is optional for purchased loans):

o Sex
o Annual income
Price-related data:
Institutions must report the rate spread between the annual percentage rate
(APR) and the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date
the interest rate is set or locked.
▪ The annual percentage rate is the annualized percentage of the dollar
amount the loan will cost over the life of the loan
▪ The average prime offer rate is the average APRs of prime or the best
borrowers reported every week by Freddie Mac
▪ Rate spread disclosure requirement:
Lien status Spread Reporting requirement
First > 1.5% Home purchase loans,
