Down Payment
The difference between the purchase price of a property and the loan amount is down payment. It may
also be stated as a relationship to loan-to-value (LTV). If the LTV is 80 percent, then the expected down
payment would be 20 percent. Down payment should come from the borrower’s own funds and should
not be provided by the seller or lender.
Example
Sales Price $200,000
Loan amount $160,000
Down payment $40,000
or
Sales Price 100% ($200,000) same as appraised value
Loan-to-Value 80%
Down payment 20%

Loan-to-Value
Loan-to-Value includes three categories of values: LTV, CLTV and TLTV.
• Loan-to-Value (LTV) – The loan amount as a percentage of the purchase price of a property or the appraised value
whichever is less. Loan to value is always based on the first mortgage.
• Combined Loan-to-Value (CLTV) – Combined Loan-to-Value involves more than one loan. In this case the loans are
combined as a percentage of the value. When there is a first mortgage and a second mortgage, the LTV would be
based on the first mortgage and the CLTV is a combination of both mortgages.
• Total Loan-to-Value (TLTV) – Total Loan-to-Value describes the total loans in relation to the value. It is generally
used when there is a refinance transaction that may include a Home Equity Line of Credit (a revolving account)
where the borrower does not use the entire credit line immediately at closing. In this scenario, the LTV would be
the amount of the first mortgage, the CLTV would include the amount of the first mortgage plus the amount drawn
from the HELOC at closing, and the TLTV would be the total amount of all loans including the maximum amount
available with the HELOC.
Example 1 Loan-to-Value LTV
A borrower is looking to purchase a house and has a 20% down payment. The appraised value is $220,000 and the
real estate agent negotiated a purchase price of $200,000. The Loan-to-Value is based on the purchase price
because it is lower.
Appraised Value $220,000
Purchase price $200,000
Down payment $40,000
Loan amount $160,000
Loan-to-Value (loan amount/purchase price) $160,000/$200,000 = 80%

Example 2 Combined-Loan-Value (CLTV)
The same borrower in the example above does not have enough for a 20 % down payment. The bank would only
lend him 80% for the purchase. He only has enough for a $25,000 down payment, so he decides to get a second
mortgage for $15,000. This means his LTV will be 80% and his CLTV will be 87.5%. Let’s see how this is calculated:
Appraised Value $220,000
Purchase Price $200,000
Down Payment $25,000
Second Mortgage $15,000
First Mortgage $160,000
Loan-to-Value (LTV) $160,000/$200,000 = 80%
First mortgage loan amount/purchase price
Combined Loan-to-Value (CLTV) ($160,000 + $15,000)/$200,000 = 87.5%
(First mortgage + second mortgage)/purchase
price
Example 3 Total-Loan-to-Value (Refinance with a first mortgage and a
HELOC)
In this scenario, the borrower wants to refinance his home to lower his interest rate and get some additional
cash. The house appraised for $200,000 and the bank offered him a maximum loan of $160,000, which was
enough to pay off the old loan and cover the closing costs. However, this does not leave any additional money for
other expenses. The borrower accepts the bank’s offer because of the low interest rate. He then decides to go to
another mortgage company and apply for a line of credit secured by the remaining equity in the home. The other
company offers him a HELOC for $20,000. He decides to accept the offer and withdrew $10,000 at closing to pay
for his college tuition and had a remaining balance of $10,000 left for future emergencies.
Appraised Value $200,000
First Mortgage $160,000 = LTV of 80%
HELOC $20,000
Drawn at closing $10,000
First loan plus amount drawn at closing $170,000 = CLTV of 85%
Balance left $10,000
Total available credit, first plus HELOC $180,000 = TLTV of 90%
