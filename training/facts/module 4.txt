TOPIC: DEFINITIONS
The following terms are important to know for this module and will help you improve your mortgage
vocabulary and knowledge of the universe of real estate financing. Be sure to memorize these terms to
improve your exam scores.
IRS 4506C Lenders use this IRS form to order a transcript of the filed tax return or other return
information free of charge from the IRS. The borrower will sign to authorize the lender
to receive their previously completed taxes.
Gross Monthly An individual's total personal income each month, before accounting for taxes or
Income deductions, including social security, Medicare, and taxes.
PITIA An acronym for principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and other assessments. These
are components of the monthly mortgage payment that is included within a debt-
to-income ratio (DTI).
Reminder: DTI is the total monthly debts, including the proposed mortgage
payment, as a percentage of the borrower’s monthly gross income.
Principal The actual amount of money borrowed and is the loan amount.
Interest The fee a borrower pays a lender for the right to have access to the money (loan or
principal) is called interest.
Taxes More specifically, property taxes. These taxes will vary depending on local tax rates
and a property’s assessed value.
This is assessed annually and requires the lender to divide the total by 12 to
determine the monthly tax burden.
The tax payment amount is held in an escrow account with the loan servicer and
paid along with the principal and interest as part of the monthly mortgage
payment.
Insurance The lender will require that the borrower carry property insurance to protect both
the borrower and the lender.
This is assessed annually and requires the lender to divide the total by 12 to
determine the monthly insurance charge.

The property insurance payment amount held in an escrow account and paid along
with the principal and interest as part of the monthly mortgage payment.
Mortgage Mortgage insurance is required when the lender loans more than 80 % of the value
Insurance of the property. The insurance provides protection for the lender if the borrower
defaults on the loan. All loan programs have some form of mortgage insurance.
Mortgage insurance is part of the monthly mortgage payment.
Assessments Another fee includes a HOA fee (Homeowner Association Fee) which is also a part
of the monthly mortgage payment.
Ratio A math tool where one item is divided by another that allows for meaningful
comparisons. Some ratios are expressed as fractions or decimals, and some as
percentages.
Example ratio: Debt-to-Income ratio (DTI) is when a borrower’s debts are divided by
their income. This provides the DTI ratio.
$1,000 debt ÷ $4,000 income = 25% DTI ratio
Housing
Payment Ratio Housing payment (PITIA) divided by income (before tax). The ratio is used by
or Housing lenders to qualify borrowers for a mortgage. The limit is generally 28%.
Expense Ratio
Amortization A number used to easily compute for monthly amortization payments. It ‘factors’
Factor enough principal and interest into each monthly payment so the loan is paid off by
a specific date.

TOPIC: DEBT-TO-INCOME (DTI)
DTI Review
Key Points About Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):
▪ The residential mortgage industry uses the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio as one
of the major factors in determining an applicant’s ability to repay the loan
▪ DTI ratio is expressed as a percentage
▪ Borrower’s monthly debt (D) ÷ gross monthly income (I) = DTI ratio %
To help remember:
▪ The debts will always be substantially smaller
▪ Debt goes on top of equation
▪ Generally, the DTI ratio should be below 36% to get a qualified mortgage (with
some exceptions)
Percentages:
▪ There are different DTI percentages based on the loan program
▪ DTI smaller than 36% is preferable with no more than 28% of the income being
applied to repay the mortgage or mortgage payment
Monthly Income
The two components of DTI are a borrower’s monthly income and debt. When determining a
borrower’s monthly income and debt you’ll need to start with their gross monthly income.
Key Points Income before deductions:
▪ Start with the borrower’s income
▪ Count income before deductions (i.e., before social security, Medicare, and
taxes are withheld)
▪ Gross monthly income = annual income ÷ 12 months
Gross monthly income considerations:
▪ Income before deductions
▪ Frequency of paychecks
▪ Average part-time/temporary employment income
▪ Average self-employment income
▪ Non-employment/non-taxable income
Frequency of paychecks:
▪ Hourly
Formula:
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 9 | 23
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
o Hourly rate x hours worked weekly x weeks worked in the year =
annual income ÷ 12 = gross monthly income
▪ Semi-monthly, paid twice a month
Formula:
o Semi-monthly pay x 2 = gross monthly income
▪ Bi-Weekly, paid every two weeks
Formula:
o Bi-weekly pay x 26 = annual income ÷ 12 = gross monthly income
▪ Monthly
Formula:
o Annual income ÷ 12 = gross monthly income
Qualified income from part-time, seasonal, or temporary employment:
▪ Average the income over a two-year period
▪ Take total income last 2 years ÷ 24 months = gross monthly income
Who is considered self-employed:
▪ Persons working for themselves
▪ Persons who own 25% or more of a company
▪ Company employees who receive ≥ 25% income from commission or
incentives
▪ Persons who work and are paid by family members
Self-employed requirements:
▪ Provide the most recent 2 years of filed tax returns
▪ Use income after deductions (i.e., expenses, depreciation of assets, etc.)
▪ Underwriter income considerations:
o If declining income, may use most recent income
o If decline indicates risk, may not qualify borrower
o Profit and loss statement generally required
Reminder Important:
Regarding depreciated assets; because the mortgage industry recognizes that
depreciation isn’t really a cash deduction, the depreciated amount can be added
back into the applicant’s income, thus increasing their qualifying income.
Non-employment/taxable income
▪ Applicants can use income from non-employment sources
▪ Income from non-employment activities:
o Social security (may be taxable)
o Child support (not taxable)
o Alimony (taxable)
o Disability (may be taxable depending on type)
▪ Must meet these conditions to qualify:
o Likely income will continue for the next 3 years
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 10 | 23
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
o Supported by documentation and historical activity
o Generally, income associated with children ends when the child
reaches the age of 18
Reminder Important:
Underwriting for mortgage loans will only consider the income through age 18.
For non-taxable income:
▪ When using non-taxable income, must increase it to meet equivalent gross
income
▪ Simplest method to ‘gross up’:
o Non-taxable income x 125% = grossed up income (i.e., approximates if
borrower has a 25% tax rate)
Reminder Important:
It is unlawful to qualify one applicant using gross income, (which includes social
security, Medicare, and withholding) and another applicant using non-taxable
income (which does not have the taxable items included).
For that reason, non-taxable income is increased (grossed up) by 125%.

Debt Obligations
As the MLO, once you’ve determined the qualifying income the borrower(s) can use, the next step is to
calculate the borrower’s recurring monthly debts and the available amount for the housing payment.
Rely on Fannie Mae’s underwriting guidelines.
Key Points Fannie Mae describes obligations that should and should NOT be considered in
underwriting the loan.
Not considered debt obligations:
▪ Utilities/cell phones
▪ Business debt in borrower’s name
o A self-employed borrower may claim a monthly obligation (that appears
on their personal credit report)
▪ Debts paid by others
o A borrower may not be obligated on a non-mortgage debt (i.e.,
installment, revolving, lease payments, alimony, child support, and
separate maintenance)
▪ Loans secured by financial assets
o When a borrower uses his or her financial assets (i.e., life insurance
policies, 401(k) accounts, IRAs, CDs, stocks, bonds, etc.) as security for a
loan
o Lender must obtain a copy of the loan instrument that shows the
borrower’s financial asset acts as collateral for the loan.
▪ Open 30-day charge accounts
o Includes 30-day charge accounts that require balances to be paid in full
every month
Considered debt obligations:
▪ Alimony/child support/separate maintenance payments
o When borrower is legally required for more than 10 months to pay
alimony, child support, or maintenance payments
o Note: voluntary payments do not need to be taken into consideration.
▪ Deferred installment debt
o When borrower doesn’t have to repay for a year or two.
o For deferred installment debts other than student loans, MLO should:
▪ Check credit report to see if it indicates the monthly amount that
will be payable at the end of the deferment period; or
▪ Obtain copies of the borrower’s payment letters or forbearance
agreements; or
▪ Use the 5% rule which means multiplying the balance by 5% and
using this amount as the qualifying monthly payment.
▪ Home equity lines of credit
o HELOC must be considered as part of the borrower’s recurring monthly
debt obligations
▪ Garnishments
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 15 | 23
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
o All garnishments with more than ten months remaining must be
included
▪ Installment debt
o All installment debt that is not secured by a financial asset (i.e., student
loans, automobile loans, and home equity loans) must be included if
there are more than ten monthly payments remaining
o However, an installment debt with fewer monthly payments remaining
also should be considered as a recurring monthly debt obligation if it
significantly affects the borrower’s ability to meet his or her credit
obligations
▪ Revolving accounts
o Revolving charge accounts and open lines of credit (i.e., credit cards,
department store charge cards, etc.) are open-ended and should be
treated as long-term debts
o If the credit report does not show a required minimum payment amount
(and there is no supplemental documentation to support a payment of
less than 5%), the lender must use 5% of the outstanding balance as the
borrower's recurring monthly debt obligation
▪ Student Loans
o All student loans must be included
o If the credit report does not provide a monthly payment for the student
loan, or if the credit report shows $0 as the monthly payment (which
may be the case for deferred loans or loans in forbearance), the lender
must calculate a qualifying monthly payment using one of the options
below:
▪ 1% of the outstanding student loan balance (even if this
amount is lower than the actual fully amortizing payment),
or
▪ A fully amortizing payment using the documented loan
repayment terms.
Reminder Important:
You probably noticed in some instances with deferred debt, or with debt that carried
no minimum payment, underwriters will at times use the 5% rule. That means they’ll
look at the balance and apply 5% as the monthly recurring debt obligation.
Mortgage Payment as Debt
All loan programs provide some limitations on how much the mortgage payment may be; this limit is
usually determined as a percentage of the gross monthly income. This ratio of the monthly mortgage
payment to the borrower’s gross monthly income is referred to as the “front end ratio” quoted as a
percentage of gross monthly income.
You may remember PITIA is the acronym that describes the monthly mortgage. It stands for:
Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance, and Other Assessments.
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 16 | 23
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
Key Points Principal
▪ The amount loaned out is the principal
▪ Example: a home cost $250,000 and the borrower puts down 20%, or $50,000,
what they owe to the lender is $200,000 (principal)
Interest
▪ The ‘fee’ for loaning money to borrowers
▪ Interest rate to charge on loan is based on market conditions and the lender’s
desired profit
▪ Because mortgage payments are paid monthly, the interest is paid monthly
(called ‘periodic interest’)
o Annual interest rate formula: loan x interest rate = annual interest paid
Example:
▪ $200,000 (loan) x 5% (interest) = $10,000 (annual interest)
o Periodic interest rate formula: annual interest rate ÷ 12 months =
periodic interest
Example:
▪ 5% (interest) ÷ 12 months = .42% (periodic interest)
o Monthly interest formula: principal x periodic interest rate = monthly
interest
Example:
▪ $200,000 (loan) x .42% (periodic rate) = $840 (interest each
month)
▪ Fixed loan payments: (principal and interest) are the same for the life of the
loan
▪ Fully amortized loans: pay off loan by a specific date (i.e., within 10, 15, 30
years)
Amortization Factor
▪ Most lenders depend on software or tables to identify how much the borrower
should pay in principal and interest (P&I) each month
▪ These tables rely on a numeric value called a ‘factor’
▪ Steps to calculate P&I using a table:
1. Locate factor from amortization table (locate the correct interest rate
and length of loan)
2. Formula 1: loan amount ÷ 1,000 = (number of times 1,000 goes into
loan)
3. Formula 2: (number of 1,000s) x factor = P&I (principal and interest)
payment
4. Note: the borrower’s P&I amount is before other items in PITIA like
taxes, insurance, and assessments
5. Example:
▪ If amortization factor = 5.37
▪ If loan is $200,000, then formula 1 is $200,000 ÷ 1,000 = 200
▪ Formula 2 is; 200 x 5.37 = $1074 (P & I)
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 17 | 23
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
Principal vs. Interest
▪ Once P&I is calculated and periodic interest is calculated, MLO can subtract the
interest from P&I payment to determine how much is going to the principal each
month.
Example:
o Month 1: $1,074 (P&I) - $840 (interest) = $234 (principal)
o Month 2: updates after 1st payment:
▪ $200,000 (principal) - $234 (principal paid) = $199,766 (updated
principal balance)
▪ To calculate next month’s interest with updated lower principal;
$199,766 x .42% = $839.02 (updated monthly interest payment)
o Month 2 calculation: $1,074 (P&I) – $839.02 (interest) = $234.98
o Repeat each month until loan paid in full
Taxes and Insurance
▪ Generally, taxes and insurance are billed on an annual basis
▪ To calculate: (potential annual tax + insurance bill) ÷ 12 = monthly liability
Additional Requirements:
Whenever a lender is loaning more than 80 % of the value or loan-to-value (LTV) is
greater than 80%, the loan is considered a higher risk and lender will apply additional
requirements to reduce the risk, including escrow and mortgage insurance.
▪ Escrow account for taxes and insurance
o Borrower pays the lender the prorated monthly portion of the annual
taxes and insurance bill with the P&I payment
o T&I (taxes/insurance) amount is held by the lender (servicer) in a prepaid
account (escrow or impound account)
o Ensures funds are guaranteed when required
o The lender (servicer) will pay taxing authority and the insurance
company directly from the funds in the escrow account
▪ Mortgage Insurance
o Mortgage insurance required when LTV (loan-to-value) is greater than
80% to protect the lender against a borrower’s default
o Other loan programs also have mortgage insurance as a requirement
o Mortgage insurance company will pay the lender based on the amount
of coverage that is agreed to in the instance of a default
o Mortgage insurance premium is calculated on an annual basis and paid
on a periodic monthly basis
o Payment is in addition to the principal, interest, taxes, and property
related insurance
o The mortgage insurance premium is based on:
▪ Loan-to-value
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 18 | 23
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
▪ Borrower’s credit
▪ Other variables
o Because of these variables, a factor is determined by the mortgage
insurance company or by the rules established for a particular loan
program and then applied to the loan amount
Assessments
▪ Last part of PITIA (the ‘A’)
▪ Assessments may include:
o Home Owners’ Association fee (HOA) associated with a
home/condominium
o Planned Unit Development (PUD) fee
o Payments may be billed annually
o To calculate: annual assessment ÷ 12 = monthly assessment (added to
PITIA)
Summary
In summary, a consumer’s income and debts are primary components of the loan
qualifying process.
▪ The total monthly debts include PITIA (mortgage payment)
▪ DTI ratio = total monthly debts (debts + PITIA) ÷ monthly gross income
▪ Recurring debts, regardless of the payment frequency, are generally included
▪ Some debts like utilities and telephone expenses are not included
▪ The mortgage payment is comprised of just the interest payment (if interest-only
loan program selected) or includes the principal
▪ Mortgage payments also include taxes, insurance, and other assessments (PITIA)

Housing Payment Ratio
It’s important to know that all loan programs limit the mortgage payment amount as a standalone debt
and percentage of the monthly gross income.
Key Points ▪ This requirement is known as the Housing Payment Ratio (or Housing Expense
Ratio)
▪ To calculate: PITIA ÷ borrower’s income
Example:
o $1,552 (PITIA or monthly mortgage payment) ÷ $6,500 income = 23.9%
▪ Most lenders prefer housing expense ratios ≤ 28%
▪ Other loan programs have different requirements for this ratio:
o FHA is ≤ 31%
o VA is ≤ 41%
o USDA is ≤ 29%

ACTIVITY: Q&A
Here are a few common questions related to the previous topic.
Q: Can you explain LTV again?
A: LTV stands for Loan-to-Value. It’s the ratio as a percentage of the loan compared with total
appraised property value. If property is appraised at $250,000 and borrower only puts down
$50,000 which leaves 80% LTV.
Q: Is the HOA always factored into the PITIA?
A: Yes, HOA fees are always included in PITIA and are generally not paid by the servicer.
Q: Is there a penalty for a borrower if they choose to pay more on their monthly payments?
A: It depends on the type of loan product selected. Most allow borrowers to pay more toward
their principal, thus paying off the loan sooner and decreasing their interest paid over the life
of the loan.
