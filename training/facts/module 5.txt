TOPIC: FHA
This topic will review 3 government backed programs starting with the FHA. It will be important to
understand what makes each program unique.
Key Points FHA History
▪ Created by the National Housing Act of 1934
▪ Provides affordable housing and protections to borrowers
▪ FHA, unlike Fannie Mae, does NOT purchase loans. FHA insures
loans by covering a lender’s loss in the event of a borrower’s
default.
▪ References to FHA may also be a reference to HUD as it may be a
HUD policy that is implemented within FHA
FHA Loan Features:
▪ Low down payment
▪ Longer terms
▪ More liberal underwriting requirements
▪ Allows for gift funds
▪ Seller concessions are allowed
▪ In most cases mortgage insurance referred to as a mortgage
insurance premium (MIP) is required
▪ Loans are assumable
▪ Borrower Eligibility
FHA Loan Types:
▪ Section 203(b) – Insured Mortgage
▪ Section 203(k) – Rehabilitation loan
▪ Section 251 – ARM loans
FHA Loan Limits
▪ FHA loan limits based on Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA)
▪ The maximum loan amount based on 65% of conforming loan limit
for a single-family property in low-cost areas.
FHA and Insurance
▪ The FHA mortgage insurance program has both an up-front
mortgage insurance premium (UFMIP) and a monthly insurance
premium (MIP).
▪ UFMIP is paid at closing or financed into the loan, and annual
mortgage insurance paid on a monthly basis as part of the PITIA.
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 11 | 30
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
▪ The MIP with FHA is very important because it is utilized to fund the
insurance payments that are provided to the lenders in the event of
a borrower’s default. That coverage is 100% of the lender’s loss.
FHA Up Front Mortgage Insurance (UFMIP)
▪ All full qualifying purchases and refinance transactions require
UFMIP
▪ Cost is 1.75% of the loan amount
▪ Can be financed into the loan
▪ Can be financed over the FHA loan amount limits
▪ Can be paid by the seller as a concession
▪ Can be refunded under the following condition:
o Refinancing to another FHA loan within a 3-year period
o Refund is prorated over a 3-year period
Annual Mortgage Insurance
Annual mortgage insurance varies and is based on the loan amount, loan
term, and loan-to-value:
▪ Paid monthly with the PITIA payment
▪ Minimum annual MIP term is 11 years
▪ Maximum annual MIP term is the loan term
FHA Qualifying Guidelines
FHA (like all other loan programs) has requirements for mortgage payment
and DTI ratios for manually underwritten loans.
▪ Mortgage payment ratio = 31% (PITIA ÷ Income)
▪ DTI ratio = 43% [(Debt + PITIA) ÷ Income]
FHA TOTAL Scorecard
FHA uses an automated underwriting program with a custom algorithm to
determine the loan decision. The program is called the FHA TOTAL
Scorecard.
FHA Credit Score
FHA down payment requirements are tied directly to the representative
credit score.
▪ Minimum credit score 580 – down payment 3.5%
▪ Minimum credit score 500-579 – down payment 10%
▪ Credit scores below 500 are not eligible for FHA financing
Seller Concessions
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 12 | 30
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
FHA will allow the seller to contribute to the borrower’s closing cost and
prepaid items:
▪ Up to 6% of the sales price
▪ Closing costs and allowable fees include origination fees, discount
points, processing, underwriting, etc.
▪ Tax service is not allowed
▪ Cannot be applied towards the down payment
FHA Anti-Flip Policy
▪ FHA will not approve a borrower for an FHA loan if the seller of the
property had owned the property for less than 90 days at the time
the sales contract was executed.
▪ FHA will require the lender to request a second appraisal at the
lender’s expense if the property is being sold for 100% or more over
the acquisition price if the contract is entered into within the 91st
day up to the 180th day after acquisition.
Reminder Important:
FHA loans use the Single-Family Policy Handbook 4000.1 to underwrite FHA
loans. A copy can be found here.

Brochure available here. All rights reserved.

TOPIC: VA
The next government backed programs to review is VA. Unlike some military benefits (healthcare,
insurance, etc.) veterans are not immediately granted the benefit of a VA loan. Like everyone else, they
must apply for the VA loan, have their credit checked, and qualify.
Key Points NOTE: Fannie Mae will purchase VA loans that stay within the Fannie Mae
conforming guidelines.
VA Loan Features
▪ VA allows 100% financing for qualified military borrowers
▪ VA does NOT have a maximum loan amount but it DOES have a
maximum guarantee amount
▪ Lenders can make loans the borrower can qualify for, however, VA
has a guarantee limit
▪ VA uses the Fannie Mae conforming loan limits as a maximum
guarantee amount for most counties around the country
▪ VA will guarantee 25% of the loan amount (up to the guarantee
amount) in the event of the borrower’s default
VA Entitlement, Discharge, and Fees
▪ A loan entitlement is a dollar amount the VA promises to repay back
to a lender in the event of a borrower’s default. Generally, it’s 25%
of the loan amount.
o Lenders will generally loan up to 4 times a Veteran's
available entitlement without a down payment, provided
the Veteran is income and credit qualified and the property
appraises for the asking price.
▪ Two tiers of entitlement:
o The first tier is up to $36,000
o The second tier is an additional entitlement up to $106,550
▪ In most counties, the maximum loan limit is $726,200. In high-cost
counties, the VA will still guarantee 25% which means the
guarantees may be higher than the $181,550 guaranty amount.
Discharge Status and Loan Eligibility
When a military borrower leaves military service, they receive a DD214
discharge document that shows proof of their service and the nature of
their discharge.
▪ To be eligible for VA guaranteed financing the borrower must:
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 19 | 30
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
o Have a certificate of eligibility (proof of entitlement)
o A DD214 discharge document reflecting an honorable
discharge
VA Funding Fee
The VA funding fee is a charge assessed by the Veterans Administration to
receive a VA guaranteed loan
▪ First time regular military user with less than 5% down are required
to pay an upfront funding fee of 2.15% of the loan amount.
▪ Subsequent use of the loan entitlement will result in increased
funding fee percentages.
▪ A borrower that is considered disabled because of military action is
exempt from paying the upfront funding fee.
▪ A surviving spouse of those who died in the service, or from service
related disabilities, are exempt from paying the funding fee.
▪ VA does not allow a refund of the funding fee if a borrower pays off
the loan.
▪ VA does not have an annual funding fee, just an upfront funding fee.
▪ VA funding fees may be financed into the loan amount, paid by the
borrower upfront, or paid by the seller.
VA Closing Costs
Seller contributions are limited to 4% of the sales price
The borrower is allowed to pay limited closing costs, some of which include:
▪ VA appraisal called a “Certificate of Reasonable Value” (CRV)
▪ Credit report fee (actual third-party charge)
▪ Hazard insurance premium
▪ Prepaid items
▪ Flood certification fee
▪ Survey
▪ Title examination and title insurance
▪ Recording fee
▪ Lender origination fee
Lender may charge a 1% flat fee to cover origination charges which can
include fees for:
▪ Underwriting
▪ Processing
▪ Application fees
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 20 | 30
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
▪ Documentation preparation
▪ Attorney fees other than for title
▪ Other loan related fees retained by the lender
Residual Income
VA is the only loan program that underwrites loans with a significant
emphasis on residual income when qualifying the borrower for a VA
guaranteed loan.
VA actually puts more value on residual income than the DTI.
Residual income calculation is based on:
▪ Loan amount
▪ Where the borrower lives
▪ Square footage of the home
▪ How many persons will occupy the home
▪ Residual income varies based on location
