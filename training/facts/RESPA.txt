mortgage loan that insures the property securing such a loan.
Basis for Charging Borrower for Force-Placed Insurance

has a reasonable basis to believe that the borrower has failed to comply with the mortgage loan contract's requirement
to maintain hazard insurance.
Before a servicer can assesses a borrower any premium charge or fee related to forced-placed insurance, the servicer
must:
▪ Deliver to a borrower or place in the mail a written notice at least 45 days before a servicer assesses on a borrower
such charge or fee.
▪ If no evidence that the insurance is in place, the creditor may deliver a second notice 15 days after the initial notice.
