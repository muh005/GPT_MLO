Regulation Z
Truth-in-Lending Act
(12 CFR 1026.22) –Subpart C
Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
A measure of the cost of credit, expressed as a yearly rate
A creditor must ensure the APR is accurate by meeting the following conditions:
▪ annual percentage rate is accurate if it is not more than 1/8 of 1 percentage point above or below the annual
percentage rate determined for regular transactions (fixed rate products).
Ex. MLO discloses to a borrower a particular APR associated with a $100,000 loan amount; then the MLO adds
additional fees of $100 to the Loan Estimate resulting in a changes to the APR. Since the $100 is less than 1/8 of 1
percentage point (.00125 x $100,000 = $125) from the initial APR, the APR is still accurate and the MLO would not
have to redisclose the new APR to the borrower.
▪ annual percentage rate is accurate if it is not more than 1/4 of 1 percentage point above or below the annual
percentage rate determined for irregular transactions (adjustable-rate products).
NOTE: Regular transactions are fixed rate products. Irregular transactions are adjustable rate products.

to each if the notice is delivered in compliance with provisions of the E-Sign Act).

 Known as TILA Section 32
 Referred to as Section 32 Mortgages or High-Cost loans

HOEPA Regulation Z
Home Ownership Equity Protection Act
(12 CFR 1026.32)
Thresholds
HOEPA has three tests to determine if a mortgage exceeds the HOEPA thresholds:
 The APR (uses the Average Prime Offer Rate (APOR) as a basis for this threshold)
 The Points and Fees
 The Pre-payment Penalty
HOEPA excludes
 Reverse mortgages
 Construction loans
HOEPA Regulation Z
Home Ownership Equity Protection Act
(12 CFR 1026.32)
APR Coverage Test
A loan is a high cost mortgage if the APR calculated with the locked-in rate exceeds the Average Prime
Offer Rate (APOR)* (which is an average of the APRs of prime borrowers in the United States during the
previous week) by more than:
6.5% on a first lien
o
8.5% on a first lien less than $50,000
o
8.5 % on a junior lien transaction
o
NOTE "Average Prime Offer Rate" means an annual percentage rate for “A” prime rated consumers who
closed on their loans last week. The Federal Reserve Board (Board) publishes the APOR weekly. Lender uses
this number to establish the threshold for the current week.
HOEPA Regulation Z
Home Ownership Equity Protection Act
(12 CFR 1026.32)
APR Coverage Test Example
6.5% on a first lien
o
8.5% on a first lien less than $50,000
o
8.5 % on a junior lien transaction
o
Let’s assume the APOR last week was 3%, add 6.5% to get 9.5%, the APR threshold for a first lien. If an MLO has a
borrower whose APR for their first lien loan exceeds 9.5%, then they would have a high-cost loan. If a borrower has a
second lien loan that exceeds 11.5%, then they would have a high-cost loan.
>
6.5% + 3% = 9.5% (APR Threshold)
(1st Lien) (APOR)
8.5% + 3% = 11.5% (APR Threshold)
(2nd Lien) (APOR)
HOEPA Regulation Z

8% of the total loan amount, or $1,243 , for loan amounts less than $24,866
Pre-payment Penalty Test
A transaction is a high-cost mortgage if a prepayment penalty is charged for:
More than 36 months after closing
o
An amount more than 2% of the amount prepaid
o

(12 CFR 1026.35)
APR Coverage Test Example
1.5% on a first lien
o
2.5% on a jumbo loan
o
3.5 % on a second lien
o
Let’s assume the APOR last week was 3%, add 1.5% to get 4.5%, the APR threshold for a first lien. If a MLO has a
borrower whose APR for their first lien loan is greater than or equal to 4.5%, then they would have a higher-priced
loan. If a borrower has a second lien loan that is greater than or equal to 6.5%, then they would have a higher priced
loan.
