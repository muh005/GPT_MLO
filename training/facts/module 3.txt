TOPIC: CREDIT REPORTING 101
Credit Reporting directly impacts you as a MLO along with your customer.
Credit History
One of your primary responsibilities is to ensure the borrower can repay the loan. That has been
enshrined into law through the Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule.
Key Points There are the 8 factors used to determine a consumer’s ability to repay the loan:
1. Income and Assets (exclude value of property securing the loan)
2. Employment status
3. Mortgage payments, considering fully indexed rate or introductory rate
(whichever is higher)
4. Fully amortized payments
5. Simultaneous loans on same dwelling
6. Monthly payments for taxes, insurance, and homeowner assoc. fees
7. Current debt obligations including alimony, child support, and:
o Installment debt (i.e., cars, appliances, etc.)
o Revolving debt (i.e., credit cards, etc.)
o Existing mortgages not being paid off
o Debt-to-income ratio and residual income
8. Credit history
FCRA: Fair Credit Reporting Act
Key Points Consumer Reporting Agencies (Credit Bureaus):
▪ Credit reporting includes a history of a consumer’s credit
▪ Credit reports reflect the status of a consumer’s file at one or more of the
national consumer reporting agencies or credit bureaus:
o Equifax
o Experian
o Transunion
Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA):
▪ Congress passed a law in 1970 called the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 7 | 15
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
▪ The law is implemented by Regulation V, and is Title VI of the Consumer Credit
Protection Act
▪ FCRA is enforced by the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau)
FCRA has three primary objectives:
▪ Prevent the misuse of sensitive information by limiting the access to recipients
who have a legitimate need
▪ Improve the accuracy and integrity of credit reports
▪ Promote the efficiency of the nation’s banking and consumer credit systems
Credit Report Basics

o Type of accounts (i.e., mortgage, installment, revolving)
o Name of creditor
o Date opened and or closed
o Credit amount limit
o Current balance
o Payment history
o Status (current or past due, in collection)

Key Points Consumer Disclosure
FCRA requires that consumers receive a copy of their credit scores whenever
they’re used in connection with a real estate transaction.
What are the time limits?
FCRA requires the following timing limits for reporting certain information in a
credit report:
▪ Bankruptcy filings may only be reported for a period of ten years
▪ All other derogatory credit reporting is limited to seven years:
o Civil suits
o Judgments
o Paid tax liens
o Charged off accounts
What about disputes?
▪ FCRA requires that CRA’s respond to consumer disputes as follows:
o They have a thirty-day timeframe for completion of an investigation
o They must provide mandatory written notice to the consumer of the
results within five days of completion of the investigation
FICO: Fair Isaac & Company
How does Fannie Mae come into this story? Well, they established a relationship with the Fair Isaac and
Company, the folks who developed the (FICO) credit scoring system you might have heard of.
Key Points FICO Scoring System:
The FICO scoring model is the standard that continues to be used in real estate loan
transactions.
▪ Examines things like payment history, accounts owed, length of credit history,
new and credit mix.
▪ Each of the factors are weighted differently
▪ System creates a numerical value:
o Determines the risk associated with a borrower by creating a numerical
value that lenders use as part of the credit qualifying process
o Each of the 3 national credit bureaus provide a score based on their
model for credit scoring within the FICO scoring system
FICO credit score ranges:
The higher the score the lower the risk to the lender.
▪ Low score = 300
PE Comprehensive Course | Learning Resource | version 12012022 P ag e 9 | 15
Ameritrain Mortgage Institute. All Rights Reserved.
▪ High score = 850
What to do with multiple scores:
▪ Generally, lenders won’t accept a single score from one of the CRA (Credit
Reporting Agencies)
▪ When 2 scores are provided to the lender, the lower score is used (otherwise
referred to as the representative score)
▪ When 3 scores are provided to a lender, the middle score is used (otherwise
referred to as the representative score)
▪ If multiple borrowers, then the lender uses the lowest of the representative
scores
RMCR: Residential Mortgage Credit Report
As you can imagine, with a couple borrowers involved, the lender could purchase up to 6 credit reports.
To save time and eliminate some of the duplication, lenders use a third-party credit reporting agency
reseller.
Key Points ▪ Combine 3 CRAs: These companies (also known as mortgage reporting
companies), combine the credit reporting from the 3 CRAs (Credit Reporting
Agencies), into a single, concise credit report which lenders can then purchase.
▪ Supplemental info: This credit report is called an “RMCR,” or Residential
Mortgage Credit Report. Not only does it include info from the 3 CRAs, it also
includes supplemental data, such as paid off accounts and employment
verification.
Adverse Notice (Risk Based Pricing)
What if a consumer’s credit is not the best? The lender may choose to offer something called ‘risk-
based pricing’.
Key Points Adverse action notice for risk-based pricing:
▪ Borrower must receive an adverse action notice for risk-based pricing.
▪ Borrower has 60 days from the receipt of an adverse action notice to request a
free credit report

TOPIC: SECURITY
Credit Reporting directly impacts you as a MLO along with your customer.
Security eMagazine
With your security, and the security of your future consumers in mind, back in 2003, Congress expanded
the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This extension was called Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act
(FACTA).
Not only did it tackle identity theft, it established a fraud alert system, required companies to hide credit
card numbers, and set up secure information disposal procedures.
The link provided below gives you access to the Ameritrain digital security eMagazine. In the issue, you
will find details about this law and other security related information you must understand in order to
perform your MLO responsibilities, while protecting your customers.
